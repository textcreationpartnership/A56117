            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THese Papers were written first for the use of a private Person, and if he had treated them with that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility he ought, they had not suffered this Impression: If therefore they reflect more unpleasantly on him than in their first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, he may thank himself. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I thought it but just, that he who would not endure to read them or hear them read (tho importuned by a Reverend Divine) lest he should thereby be provoked to <hi>Good Works</hi> or convinced of his sinful neglect of them, should himself be made a provocation thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But since they had the misfortune to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nothing of their first Design, I have conceived some others, to which I would make this serve, for which I now make
<pb facs="tcp:37329:4"/> them publick, hoping that it will please God (in obedience to whose Precept, there mentioned, they were first written, and for whose service they are now Printed) so to bless them, that they may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fruitless.</p>
                  <p>Yhere may be some in the World (I fear too many) that are such as he, and who knows but that these Papers may have good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on some of them; to shame them out of their base and unmanly scraping, and make them liberal.</p>
                  <p>Others there are who are not so sordid and shameless in their scraping, yet have such a distrust of Gods Providence, a fearful mind, so dreading to want them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they cannot find in their hearts to relieve others, tho in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity and very deserving; and while they think they can be only safe and warm in their own Downe, they inwrap them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves close and thrust out Brissles (with the <hi>Hedg-Hog</hi>) towards all that perswade them to <hi>Good Works.</hi> These are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted daily while it is called to-day, lest they should be hardned through the deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of sin; and I hope this Paper may contribute somewhat to the performance of my Duty herein.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:37329:4"/>

                     </gap>es in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, being but learning the Duties of that Religion against the time they shall become capable to perform them; these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed with a conceipt of the baseness and indecency of a scraping covetous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will be antidoted against the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto; so that when, by a sense of their want of these Riches for the purposes of Life, Sathan would make way for that poyson of Covetousness to insinuate it self, he will not be able to effect it.</p>
                  <p>The last sort are such in whom these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous desires have been prevented, and a habit of Charity and Munificence introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (by the Grace of God concurring with a Vertuous Education) which afterwards (being followed on with faithful endeavours of their own) become so perfect, that Love becomes their very Nature, and <hi>Good Works</hi> their chiefest delight and pleasure; and whether they please Men or displease them, 'tis only to profit them: these cannot cease to do well, and will never learn to do ill. The abundance of Love to God and their Neighbour, that dwells in their hearts, will quench all suggestions to Mallice or Revenge (which are the Fiery Darts of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than)
<pb facs="tcp:37329:5"/> and will so cherish all Motions to <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> that they will send forth abundant Fruits thereof unto the good Example of others; and in nothing do these more exult than when they can oblige a multitude to bear them company in doing <hi>Good Works.</hi> These are the Men I most highly value, For that Charity is the Bond of Perfection and Life of Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which whoever liveth, is counted but dead before God and all good Men.</p>
                  <p>I hope that those will find this Book to agree so well with the temper of their minds, that they will be-friend it with a kind Reception, and help the propagation thereof to the ends of its publication, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this City,</p>
                  <p>I know some will find fault with my long Digressions, of which I must therefore give account. My Studies are the Divertize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a forced Retirement, and very much broken off by my return to business, so that I cannot attend any exact Method, but must prosecute my designed End by such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as seems conducible thereunto, though it be digresive from the Rules of Order, and I hope there is none of these Digressions but may have a good Influence to dispose the mind to <hi>Good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:37329:5"/>
                  <p>The first and last (which have most of Digresion, I was drawn into by occasion of an endeavour to reduce an Eminent person in this City, who had changed the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> for the <hi>Cracovian Faith,</hi> believing in a Trinity consisting of the only True God <hi>The Father,</hi> A Vice God <hi>The Son,</hi> and a Chief Angel that is no God at all <hi>The Holy Ghost:</hi> hereupon my mind being agitated with many thoughts about the Doctrine of the Trinity, and desirous to shew that there was something wherein One Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Essence may be conceived to have Three distinct Subsistences, as it is in the Essence of One Natural and Moral Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (which he denied to be possible) and also that there was somewhat in that Doctrine that was not meer Matter of Speculation (as he said the whole was) but apt to form our hearts and minds to the similitude of Gods Perfections with my Experience that the study of this tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prepare the mind to a readiness to all <hi>Good Works.</hi> I say this occasioned these Digressions, wherein if the intention of my mind hath transported me above what I am fit for, I begg pardon of the Learned.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:37329:6"/>
                  <p>I know some dislike all Enquiries into the <hi>Modus</hi> of the Subsistence of the Trinity in Ʋnity, but since, besides the discovery of the Eternal Power and God-head of the Deity, which we have in <hi>Gods Works</hi> in general, he hath given us a resemblance, in the Nature of our own Souls, of the powers of Volition, Intellection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Operation, contained in that God-head, the Substance and Essence whereof is incomprehensible, as that of our own Souls also is; and since he hath given us a capacity, and made it our Duty to aspire to be perfect, as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in all Moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) I cannot see but that, while we confess the Incomprehensibility of his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Essence, we may enquire into what may be known of his Adorable and Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perfections.</p>
                  <p>But I hope this will pass with the more favourable censure, because herein I follow no less a man than the Renowned <hi>Hooker Ecles. Pol. p. 22.</hi> saith he, <hi>The Father as Goodness, the Son as Wisdom, the Holy Ghost as Power, do all concur in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, outwardly issuing from that One only Glorious Deity which they all are; for that which moveth God to Work is Goodness,
<pb facs="tcp:37329:6"/> that which ordereth his Work is Wisdom, that which Perfecteth his Work is Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if what I have herein written with a sincere desire of his Conversion (as well as of common good) shall, by Gods Blessing, effect his further Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that matter, so that he would believe aright, as to the <hi>Substance</hi> of that Doctrine, tho he use not the same terms in expression; I should more willingly bear such Censures, let them be as sharp as they will, because while he stands in his Opinion I think no good Christian can employ him as his Almoner, nor he accept that Employment from such, as by consequence thereof must be Blasphemers and Idolaters; and then this City will scarce afford a person so able and useful in that Employment, for his Activity and Fidelity, wherein he deserves much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and honour.</p>
                  <p>I confess if I found he had a belief, that the <hi>Father Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were one and the same <hi>God;</hi> I could say as that Learned Author of the Vindication of the Defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet, p. 173.</hi>
                     <q>God forbid that all the Nice Distinctions of the Schools about Essence, Substance, Personality, Eternal Generation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
<pb facs="tcp:37329:7"/> the difference of Filiation and Spiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be reckoned among the Fundamentals of our Religion,</q>
                     <hi>and so could have Communion with him;</hi> which now I think neither I or any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can have, since we learn from Scripture and universal consent, <hi>That a Heretick after a first and second Admonition we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> and even the <hi>Arians</hi> themselves, when by favour of the Emperor and other Arts they had established the Doctrine of the Trinity in that Empire, refused to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the <hi>Orthodox</hi> (whom they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hereticks) or to admit them to their Communion: and indeed this being declared in Baptisme to be the very Basis of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, it cannot be otherwise. And I do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by protest to him and all the World, that it is only for the Service of his Soul and the Church; and because I think (as things stand) this is all I can add to what I have already done, to bring him to a through consideration of this matter, that I have mentioned him in this Preface. Therefore good Reader, for the good success of this and of the Book, joyn with me before thou readest in this brief <hi>Col.</hi>

Now I dare warrant you Sir, if you will resolve on the Judgment &amp; Experience of others, to believe there may be a pleasure in doing <hi>Good VVorks,</hi> &amp; try the practice of them for a little time, that you will find, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did by <hi>Solomon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A pleasant story told me by a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller while I was writing I must here set down as somewhat to my purpose. There was in <hi>Genoa</hi> an Eminent Merchant, vastly Rich by trading, having only one Son, to whom (when grown to mans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state) he gave a plentiful allowance for his expence,

                     </gap>agan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the old man saw his Son would be but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while in spending what he had been long in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: he trye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by good Council to reclaim him, but; could not do it. At last he resolved, since his Estate must be spent, to take part of the pleasure of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And then he thus bespeak his Son: <hi>Come Son I see my Counsel will not prevail, but you resolve to have the pleasure in spending what I have had the pains of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I will also resolve to share of the plesaure with you; know therefore, that so much as you spend in ill Courses I will spend in Good VVorks.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whenever his Son came to him for a hundred pounds to spend in his way, he laid by a hundred pounds for himself, to spend in his. The Son liked it well enough at first, and finding he could have mony at pleasure, spent freely on his extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; the Father also fell to building of Alms-Houses and Free-Schools, and Work-Houses for the Poor, and doing other <hi>Good VVorks</hi> with his part of the Estate, and found such pleasure therein, that he grudged not his Sons pleasure in his Extravagancies at all, but was as ready to give as he to ask: The Son at last began to consider how soon the Estate would be spent, and that his Father being old had great advantage of him in this that he would enjoy the pleasure, and great Honour of his expence without any danger of wanting it afterwards, whereas when all was gone, himself might live long in disgrace and poverty; I say considering this He resolves to take up, and grow a good husband, and fo both diseases were cured, the Covetousness of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37329:13"/> the Father, and the Prodigality of the Son, and yet enough to support the Family in a very good Estate preserved.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, as this old man would never have fancyed this pleasure he found, if he had not been put upon the Tryal; so you may be sure to find the like, if by this perswasion, or any other means, you be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged to make the Experiment.

                  </q>
                  <p>Yet the Truth of it is most manifest of mankind, and in the State of Old Age.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Reported also, of an Ancient Gentleman, of <hi>Venice</hi> that he was wont, when he had observed a poor man, in whose Countenance appeared the signs of necessity and dispondency, to place himself advantageously for the purpose, &amp; then to send his man to pass by &amp; clap a piece of Gold or two, into the poor mans hand, that so he might please himself to see the Transports and Devotion that was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by so liberal an Alms. And he used to say he took more delight in so Raising the minds of men from a kind of Death, and winging their Souls for a flight to Heaven, to offer their joys &amp; praise to the most high, and in preventing, (it may be) their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death, which such necessity &amp; dispondency o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But that Consideration which from your great Age most of all moves me to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you to Good Works,</hi> is this, <hi>That you cannot in all

                  <p>You are now on the brink of Eternity, where you shall Receive according to what you have done in this Body, good or evil: for God will there ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Rewerd to every man according to his works. Now Good Works being the only sure <hi>Foundation which we are to lay up against the time to come, if we mean to lay fast hold on Eternal Life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.18, 19. what reason is there to provoke you thereunto? now least for want of Good VVorks than, you should be rejected from the Communion of the God of all Goodness, the Good Angels and Good Men, and Commanded to depart, as Accursed of God, into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore here I shall set my Foot, and insist as well as I can on this proposition, <hi>That Good Works are of absolute necessity (not only to your Respect and Honour in this World but) to your Eternal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in the World to come; I</hi> Principally intend the latter of these, the former will come in on the By.</p>
                  <p>Christ the Son of God, hath indeed undertaken to save us, and no works of our own could ever have done, without him; but he will never do it on any other Terms, than such as shall be most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, first to the pleasure and honour of his most Righteous Father, and secondly to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, &amp; wellfare of man himself &amp; to that of the Community of mankind; His participation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God in the second person of the Blessed Trinity, and his taking the Common <hi>Nature</hi> of Man (and not any ones particular <hi>Person</hi>) into the Union of his Ever Blessed Deity; this makes it im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37329:14"/> that he could ever undertake to save us otherwise, nor doth his Gospel mention any other Termes of Salvation to be made with any.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine taught by the Messenger he sent to Prepare his way, and by his own Preaching in the begining of his Ministry, had this for the Subject of it <hi>(Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

All the Prophets of Old taught this Doctrine; that no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were acceptable to God without Repentance &amp; Good Works: their oblations where vain; <q>Incense abominable; their Feasts and Solemn Assemblie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37329:15"/> Good Works <hi>Esa,</hi> 1st. the wieked must forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and return to the Lord (by obeying his Laws and imitating his Goodness) before he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon him; for though God hath no pleasure in the Death of the wicked, yet he must turn from his wickedness if he will live: for if he spoil by Violence, or Oppress the Poor, or defile his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wife, or do any such abominations, he shall surely die, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.</q> Now these Prophets Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill; his Doctrine was of the same import, he declared he came into the world to no other purpose, but to <q>Call Sinners to Repentance, and that he dyed for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity; and purifie to himself a peculiar people Zealous of Good Works. And he therefore Commands that our light so shine before men, that they may see our Good Works, and glorifie our Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and finally he tells us, that he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge none for his at the last day (be their Pleas never so obliging) if they have been workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; For not every one that saith unto him Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he only that doth the will of his Father which is in Heaven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And his holy Apostles, by Divine inspirations, taught the same Doctrine, <q>That God will render unto every man according to his works, to them that, by patient Continuance in WELL DOING, seek for glory, honour, and immortallity he will give Eternal Life, but Tribulation and Anguish to every Soul that doth evil, and warns us not to be deceived, for that the unrighteous shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

I have hinted these things to shew what the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles was in Conformity to that of the Prophets of Old, and that he remitted nothing of the necessity of Repentance and <hi>Good VVorks,</hi> but he hath added infinite Obligations thereunto: And this he did for the honour of his heavenly Father; for it would have been an infinite Disparagem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt to the Laws of God, both in Nature and Scripture, (and so to his Wisdom and Goodness, that was Author of them) if Christ should have saved us, without hearty Repentance for what we had done contrary to those Laws, and stedfast resolution for the future, to obey them in doing <hi>Good Works,</hi> and it is only by our light so shineing before men that they may see <hi>Good Works,</hi> that they will be moved to glorifie our Father which is in heaven. And the same Repentance and Obedience, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the honour of Almighty God, is also most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the happiness of the person himself that performs it, and is the great effect of Christs Salvation in him. To be saved without Repentance <hi>(i. e.)</hi> forsaking our sins and practicing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtues, is a contradition in the very Nature of the thing; for it would be to be saved, without being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37329:16"/> saved; Sin and Misery, Virtue and Felicity are, so Naturally and Inseperably conjoyned, that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the one, we most certainly become posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the other: So that for a man to be abandoned unto Pride, or Malice or Revenge, to Covetousness, Intemperance, or Discontent, is to be damned to a kind of hell upon earth; and only when he is freed from the Dominion of those and indued with Humility, Charity, Wisdom, and Sobriety, &amp; such other Virtues, I say only then, can he be truly said to be saved. To serve God is the most perfect Freedom, and to do kindnesses to Men the highest delight: and if all men would strive together, for this Evangelical Righteousness, this Earth would be a kind of Heaven. A delight in doing Good makes a man like to God, a Companion of Angels, a Delight to Mankind: And this gives him such Joy and Satisfaction in himself, as the Devil nor Wicked men can never disturb. This is indeed, that Heavenly Kingdom which was began on earth, when God in Christ Jesus came down to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and this will most certainly consign us to follow him to the possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37329:16"/> doth tend to this, that is most apparent; For in his first Sermon on the Mount, in which he most solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd his Blessed Law of our Liberty and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, half the Beatitudes are appropriated to such Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

To make this as plain and profitable as I can, I shall first explain the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Goodness</hi> and then shew how this <hi>Vice</hi> is against it.</p>
                  <p>GOODNES is the perfection of all Beings and beginner of all profitable effects, &amp; the <hi>more</hi> excellent a subject is wherein it resides, the more excellent is it's Nature and mighty it's Power. God over all is <hi>Goodness</hi> above all, <hi>Goodness</hi> in all, and <hi>Good</hi> unto all his Creatures; his <hi>Goodness</hi> hath all <hi>Perfections</hi> in it self; and therefore working within it self must beget <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> whereby to direct and govern all it's Operations <hi>ad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> The power and seed of Wisdom must needs be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>perfect Goodness;</hi> for none can form a Conception of the latter, as subsisting in intelligent beings, but as it contains the former: <hi>Wisdom</hi> Being so absolutely necessary for <hi>Goodness</hi> to work by, we cannot conceive but that, while it hath it within it self, it must operate upon it self for the Generation thereof; and that operation must be <hi>Ad ultimum Posse</hi> (as they speak) Therefore God being an infinite Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni potent Being; and in this his operation within himself, working naturally and necessarily, and so to the utmost of what he can, his Wisdom must be equally infinite and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent as his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and their subsistance in each other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and Mutual.</p>
                  <p>From these two working together within themselves must proceed an <hi>Active spirit</hi> of equal power and infinity: for as there is nothing in God but himself, so whatsoever proceeds from the operations of the Deity within it self must be God infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and Almighty. No man can conceive of <hi>Goodness</hi> but as inclining to be Active and Vigorous in doing Good, nor of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37329:21"/> such a Wisdom, <hi>(viz)</hi> that which is generated by <hi>Goodness</hi> and that hath <hi>Goodness</hi> dwelling essentially within it self; but as it is contriving and suggesting always something of excellent nature to be done, for which therefore (as judging it worthy to be done with Vigor and Activity) it must emit an <hi>Active Spirit;</hi> so that from the Disposition and Cooperation of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> such an <hi>Active spirit</hi> must proceed as may be perfectly subservient to both, &amp; of the same nature with both. Now the Divine <hi>Goodness</hi> affecting, Wisdom contriving, and <hi>his Spirit</hi> effecting the Creation of man, &amp; that in the Image and Likeness of God himself, with a mind and spirit of like powers, and also capable of like perfections to his own, I say this being so, the perfections in God must be supposed to attend the impression of themselves on man. And mans Duty, to receive them according to the capacity given him, and in such manner as is agreeable to the Nature &amp; Quality wherein he was made: Hence it will follow that the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God doth still incline, his <hi>Wisdom</hi> contrive, &amp; his <hi>spirit</hi> work towards the making us to be like himself, and that chiefly in a great delight in the happiness and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all men, and a readiness to assist the same according to our capacity and in proportion with our ability; but yet that our Nature being made intelligent and free, God will not work on us by secret impulse, and forcible Necessitation, but by Divine Revelation and Moral Swasion▪ which if we resist, we oppose our selves against God, and pervert our own faculties, and become so contrary to <hi>goodness</hi> that God must cease to be himself, if he be not contrary to us; and this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the second thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The contradiction that is in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness unto <hi>goodness;</hi> both as it is in God, in his works, &amp; in our selves.</p>
                  <p>The greatest contrariety to God, that we know among all created Beings, is <hi>the Devil;</hi> whose Character is <hi>the evil One,</hi> and evil in the very abstract. A <hi>spirit</hi> he was, Originally Lucifer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bright above all others (as is probable) and made capable to be impressed with perfections which I call Moral in all equality to those which were Natural in him: But these impressions could be made only by his applying his faculties unto God, when God was manifest unto him (as the Wax is applyed to the Seal, as well as the Seal to it) that from God these perfections might be impressed on his capable Nature, but this it may seem, he was not necessitated unto, but left
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37329:21"/> to perform according to the liberty which he had, even by nature; a liberty equal to his glory in other respects. Being made thus in greatest glory and liberty of any created Being, the <hi>infinite goodness</hi> doubtless had exhibited to him the glorys of his grace, not only in the excellency of that Nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had made him, in the Ministrys and Attendances of other inferior spirits, and a mighty Dominion given him over inferior Creatures, but in immediate Communications of himself and of his Divine favours and familiarities, and this not only to atract his Adoration, which might sufficiently have been done by the display of h s glorious greatness, but to impress the Image of his goodness on this glorious Spirit, that thereby he might be made to imitate him in all his operations, to the good of other Creatures. But it may seem that the Devil, rather applying his Cogitations to the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and greatness; the opulency, self-fufficiency and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibleness of the God-head, &amp; such like natural perfections, than to these moral perfections his <hi>goodness,</hi> &amp;c; and ungrateful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lly <hi>forgetting</hi> that those perfections of Gods essence were the Fountain of Being and all Beatitudes to himself, and by him to be adored, but not aspired unto; and <hi>preferring</hi> the pleasant conceit of being like God in those his incommunicable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, before the likeness of that <hi>goodness,</hi> which God esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his chiefest glory and delight, &amp; yet would most gladly have all his works to pertake of: THIS PLEASURE of their Proud, Ambitious, Covetous conceits and imaginations was the cause of that <hi>Malice</hi> which turned them from Angels to Devils: for nothing else, in meer Spirits, can we think of that should operate to that end.</p>
                  <p>For those spirits conceiving that the possession of all things was their felicity, and that conception and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination working a disposition to seek themselves &amp; their own satisfaction in the possession of what they found their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires incline to (which is perfectly opposite to the nature of <hi>goodness</hi>) they had now in themselves the Fountain of Evil, <hi>(viz.) a self love that is opposite to the love of God and their fellow Creatures,</hi> moving them to maligne others hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness &amp; to draw to themselves all things, whither from God or from Man, to add to their own. This was perfectly opposite to the Divine <hi>goodness</hi> &amp; utterly destroyed his Image (as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally considered) yet so as these Spirits still retained that which was natural <hi>viz.</hi> spirituallity, freedom, intelligence and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37329:22"/> activity. This malice therefore subsisting in such a Nature as that of the Devil, could operate within it self for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a Hellish Wisdom to subserve it, and these two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating in such a Nature are apt to emit or send forth an active power working upon all things within its reach for evil and mischief.</p>
                  <p>The next contrariety that appears in created Beings to the Divine <hi>goodness</hi> is in man: MAN made at first but a little lower than Angels, and with a mind indued with such powers as resembled Gods Natural perfections as well as they, and made capable also of the impression of those perfections which I call moral, and of the operations tending to effect the same: And God, having made man such a Creature, made also the glorys of his Divine <hi>goodness</hi> to shine round about him, but most of all to be manifest within himself. He brought also all the <hi>Creatures to him</hi> and shewed him, that tho they were all his own by Original right of Creation, he would make him Lord over them all, and so he gave him power to impose names on them as his own servants &amp; to be their master. He also planted <hi>a Garden of pleasure</hi> for him and placed him there, and then entertained him with <hi>great Familiarities,</hi> and descended from his Palace on high to visit him and that in sensible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his presence. He provided, to preserve him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal in this blessed state, <hi>The Tree of Life,</hi> and to teach him his duty therein was to govern himself by reason and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not by Appetite and Passion, he made the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> with a Command to forbear it to try his Obedience, this, as well as the rest, was a discovery of his <hi>goodness and wisdom.</hi> All this he did to make him good and wise like himself, &amp; to delight to do good to inferior Creatures; and, when multiplied and increased according to the Divine blessing, that men should mutually delight in the happiness of each other, and should employ themselves in interchange of kindnesses. But the Devil envying this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of man and coveting to make him his own; as he did all things else, wrought by his Serpentine Wisdom to inspire him with like <hi>Malice</hi> to himself, which to our <hi>sorrow</hi> he effected by representing the excellency of that Fruit which God had forbidden <hi>as good for Food</hi> and <hi>very desirable, for that it would make man Wise as God himself,</hi> whereby, inveigling the fancy with a secret pleasure, such as was apt to intoxicate the mind and make it sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37329:22"/> kind of happiness then what at present they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Thus he inspired them with a covetous desire of the possession and use of that Tree, which alone God had reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as his own propriety, while he gave them others in great plenty. It was Evident, if their Eyes had not been blinded by this fantastick pleasure, that they wanted neither Food nor Wisdom, nor could they use more than they had to any other purpose, but to please such an irrational Appetite of Covetousness, and yet when they had received this Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> beginning to suspect, that notwithstanding Gods Bounty towards them he envied their happiness, and thought that too much to give, which they were capable to enjoy and therefore denyed them that Tree which was good and needful for them, they became affected with a Covetous desire to have that also; and here began the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Malice which is so contrary to the Divine <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and mans true felicity▪ which consists in a <hi>Covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of what we do not want nor can use to any other purpose than to please our selves in a conceit of being Rich, great, and self-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or in an inordinate desire of what may he needful and useful unto us,</hi> but of these two the former sort of evil affection is far the greatest &amp; worst, and also doth infer the latter.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Malice</hi> contains within it self all manner of Vices, for-that, ill desires are the Root and Spring of them all, and all the Violencies, Perjuries, Murders, Roberies and whatever things you can name that are vitious, are done in prosecution of their satisfaction. The poor man, that immoderately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires what he wants; lyes &amp; steals, and cheats and couzens &amp; doth many things more for his supply. And others that want, only because they desire, and for no other cause imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet do far worse things for the supply of such want, than the most indigent in the World for supply of theirs.</p>
                  <p>God, that made man a Necessitous and Dependant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and did provide in infinite plenty for his supply, doth never forbid a moderate and regulated Desire and Appetite unto him; but when men, not considering these appetites were made for use and profit more than for sensual delight, and to be ruled by reason and not to suffocate it: I say when not considering this, and finding a delight in the acting and satisfying these desires, they suffer these Appetites of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be ridden and impregnated by Devils and Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, till they grow big and unsatiable in their desires, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37329:23"/> then these desires work on all things, yea, on the very subject wherein they are, to mischief and destruction; This is that <hi>Malice which is so contrary unto Gooddnss.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Malice</hi> becoming the habitual disposition of man, considering his rational and Active Nature, must beget in him a <hi>Wisdom</hi> to contrive for it's Exhibition and Satisfaction: And an <hi>Active Spirit</hi> will proceed from these two, influencing and acting all things according to the Evil Nature it hath in it self, but received as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Man being made intelligent, his habitual dispositions must have intelligence within them, and when once <hi>Malice</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus predominant, and hath taken possession of the man, it will so work on it self as to generate conceive and bring forth what may be servicable to the pleasing it self, and to operate to that end: the first of which productions is a <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Subtlety</hi> of equal power and operarion with it self, &amp; which partakes of its own Nature, and is such, as this <hi>Malice</hi> is, earthly, sensual and devilish. For the <hi>Malice</hi> I speak of consists of the whole Nature of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which extends to all things, and works on several Objects as they suit best with the subject wherein it is: &amp; as such it is called by several Names, <hi>Ambition, Sensuallity,</hi> &amp; <hi>Covetousness Properly</hi> so called, but all these meet in the love of Mony, which answers all things, and serves to purchase all kind of satisfactions, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Root of all <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Radical Malice,</hi> and is most contrary to <hi>goodness</hi> of all other sorts of <hi>Covetousness</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>this Malice</hi> hath conceived and brought forth this <hi>Evil Wisdom</hi> and dwells in it, so that by their operation together both are delighted &amp; increased (mans Nature being capable of such increase) these two will send forth such a Spirit as will influence all things near them, and will oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on all things about them, by the direction of that ill <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and according to the Nature of that ill <hi>Disposition</hi> from whence it proceeds.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Malice</hi> thus infused by the Devil, into the Nature of Man was soon propagated, &amp; filled the earth with Violences: Violences, some more secret (like that of a small but migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty screw:) that by little and little overturned Families and Estates that seemed strongly founded: others more open (like that of battering Rams) beating down all that oppose their rapacious prosecutions &amp; violent invasions: This was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37329:23"/> that <hi>Evil</hi> that made all <hi>Mans imaginations Evil and that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:</hi> that <hi>malum figmentum</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> called Original sin) which withdraws us from the Contemplation of Gods <hi>goodness</hi> and the Obedience of his Laws: An Evil Disposition which is perfectly contrary to His Nature who is <hi>love</hi> and <hi>Goodnes</hi> it self; and who, being in all, fills all things with Good; And contrary to that Charity &amp; Goodness which is his Image, that Charity which is <hi>kind and seeketh not her own things, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth those of others,</hi> 1 Col. 13.5.</p>
                  <p>Man living in this World in the midst of various Objects, that tempt and provoke this <hi>Evil Disposition,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil always is most intent to improve and inforce the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of them on his mind to increase the same, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may utterly destroy Gods most beautiful and glorious Image in our Souls, and impress us with his own most ugly Vizage; <hi>viz.</hi> a temper of mind so ugly, that every man hates it in another, altho' he hath it in himself, so uneasie, that none can be quiet in any state whatever that hath once put it on; at least, not till he have put it off again by Repentance.</p>
                  <p>GOODNES in God is his very Nature and Essence, and therefore must be conceived to work Naturally and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, and to the uttermost of its power; but <hi>goodness</hi> in man is not his Nature, but is impressed on his mind in the way of Gods Revelations, and by a Moral swasion given thereby; &amp; in the same way that it receives its Essence, it is also awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moved to all its operations; in all which it works, not Naturally, but freely and contingently, and therefore must excite it self, and be excited by others, to work for the Generation of such a Virtuous <hi>Wisdom</hi> as may serve to render it most profitable to it self and others, without which a <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>disposition</hi> oft betrays men to that which is pernitious to both. And so also the <hi>Malice</hi> I mention being impressed by like means, the Devil is most of all active in the use of all ways of impressing the same on us, both by inward sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and representations to our minds, and by bringing our faculties and the objects together, and when he hath once done this, he is continually exciting this <hi>Covetousness</hi> to work for the Generation of this devilish, earthly, sensual <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and doth effectually assist its operations to that end and in the same manner doth he instigate the cooperations of this <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Evil Wisdom</hi> together, to the Emission of an <hi>Active Spirit</hi> to influence all things for mischief; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37329:24"/> as I began, so I conclude, that of all Vitious Appetites &amp; passions this of <hi>Evil Covetousness</hi> is the worst and therefore most necessary to be put off by Repentance, and now I will return where I left.</p>
                  <p>BUT neither the bare Freedom from this or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Vice is sufficient of it self, nor is it to be Rested in as our Righteousness, which consists in doing Righteousness, and not only in forbearing to do <hi>Evil,</hi> for if we do rest there it will but deceive us: if a man be not guilty of ill desires of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or of subtil contrivances and base actions for acquiring the same, yet if when God hath given him Riches as a Talent to trade with, he have not used them for the doing him honour and service, and also to inable him to do the more good to his Fellows; If he have not used them in grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns for Gods Mercys and Expressions of love to his most dear and blessed Saviour, in doing Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of humanity to all men, and of Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all Christians; I say if so, he must see cause to repent for this, as well as for sins of Commission, if ever he will be saved, and that, with a Repentance that hath meet fruits too, which in this case can be only a freeness in maintaining <hi>Good Works,</hi> and a double diligence in doing them.</p>
                  <p>And here I must observe the Reason why the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are all given in the Negative and why the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby we are initiated into the Church (even now as well as that of old) is significant of the excision of sinful habits, and purification of carnal affections; And I conceive the reason to be this; The soul of man being made in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image <hi>a Sp rit (i. e.)</hi> an Active and most Vigorous principle, Light and Life, continually working as God is said by our Saviour <hi>hitherto to work:</hi> I say a soul of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture needs nothing, but what is in it self, to move it to Action: but it needs to be unburdened from that, which clogs it and disables it thereunto; And again, 'tis only the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and disease of the Soul that makes it work ill, remove

'Tis true indeed, God can bear down all this Resistance, effect what he desires, and carry on all his designs in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of us; but having made us free and Voluntary Agents, and being always consistant with himself, he is said to be resisted and defeated, when we will not be wrought on in ways suited to our Natures and the Order he hath established in the World▪ &amp; it is truly said God cannot do, that which cannot be done, but in contradiction to foregoing Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his decrees and purposes, whether it be in his word or works.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. 'tis a practical Denyal of Gods Supream Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Lordship over the world, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr a Contempt of his Providence, and that we either Question his Being, or defie his Power: and these things must needs incence his wrath and displeasure against us: Let me a little explain this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1st. there was never Lord of a Manner on Earth, but in his most bountiful Grants unto his Tennants &amp; Vassals, he still reserved to himself some Tribute of acknowledgment whereby his Original Right and Supream Dominion should be acknowledg'd. And can we think that he who is Author of this <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> in man, will himself be careless of his own Honour? No Sir, his Glory is dearer to him than a thousand worlds; and therefore though he hath given this Rich &amp; Fruitful Earth to the Children of Men to trade and dwell in, having the infinitely more Glorious Heaven for his own habitation; and though he indulge them to use all things that they can get and possess therein for the purposes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not only to supply the necessity of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37329:28"/> it, but to maintain a Grandure fit for the Estate they are Masters of therein, yet his Will and Pleasure is, that according to the measure of our possessions, we offer unto him such Sacrifices by way of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment as may preserve in our selves and declare to others the Remembrance we should have of that Original right which he hath reserved to himself in all we have, and that still he hath power to resume it, if we make a Forfeiture by ingratitude or abuse. And as this Duty belongs to all Men, so the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it is by that Law which is written in the hearts of all mankind, whence (as many think) the offerings of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and other Eucharistical Sacrifices, first proceeded (although those that were Propitiatory might come from another cause.) But, whether that be so or not, it is a thing most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that it is Gods incommunicable Right to be Lord of all, and none of us are more than his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals and Stewards; and therefore where he gives he expects to receive, and that also much, of those to whom he hath given much; though of them to whom he hath given little he expects the less. Now this can no otherwise be done but by devoting some part of our Estates, to the maintenance of some such things as either tend most immediately to his Worship and Honour (such as all the Ministry's of Religion are) or of some such persons as are more especially related unto him, and these are the Priest and the Poor: 'tis true, God hath not obliged us by any possitive Laws, for the manner or the measure of this, but leaves every one to his free Choice, that being Voluntary, it may be the more rewardable; but thence we cannot conclude, that we are not obliged to do it at all; God loves
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37329:28"/> a chearful giver, but esteems himself robbed if we give not at all; And it is no excuse to say we give Tithes of our Land, and pay our Taxes to the Poor▪ for tho the robbery be the greater when we offend against the Law of Nature and the Laws of the Land at once, yet in paying Tithes we give that which was never ours, and in paying the Poors Tax, the Law may be more properly said to give than we; there must therefore be some other way of acknowledgment besides that, which can be only by doing the <hi>Good Works</hi> I write of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing that is provoking in the Omission of <hi>Good Works</hi> is, that it is a Contempt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for he that believes that God Governs the World and disposes of all Events therein, either to the good of those that please him, or to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil Doers; I say he can never look on such a man, who neglects a thing so graetful to the Almighty as doing <hi>Good Works</hi> as any other than a Contemner of his Providence; God hath indeed, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished a fixed Course and Order in Nature, and according to this he mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s all things ordinarily to work: And so the diligent hand maketh Rich and strength prevails over weakness, and the best Legs wins the Race, &amp; the most skilful in their professions find most favour, especially with those that need them, and they get most mony that best understand their Trades; But the wise <hi>Solomon</hi> hath observed, that it often falls out otherwise, for that there are Seasons and Accidents that God always keeps in his own power, whereby he alters the ordinary course of things as he pleaseth, and this all find true by experience: Besides even when men obtain that which their Natural preparations
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37329:29"/> or their acquired Endowments tend to, there is yet need of Gods blessing to make them happy therein; <hi>Solomon</hi> had seen (and so have we) <hi>that Riches are often reserved for men to their hurt;</hi> that the abundance of the Rich hinders their rest, that great Estates makes mens Follys more remarkable (as a Jewel in a Swines Snout) and that very often they render them a more plain mark for the envy of their Inferiors, and the oppression of those above them: And so it is of all other Endowments if Gods gracious providence do not intervene. Now when men, notwithstanding all this, never think how they may oblige the Care and Blessing of the Almighty, either by fidelity in his Service, and fruitfulness in <hi>Good Works,</hi> as he expects they should, who can think but that God will resent it as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his All-disposing Providence, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a great displeasure against such proud sinners.</p>
                  <p>But 3dly. since it seems that the mind of man (if it be not utterrly blind) cannot resist the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Truth in the first Case, nor natural self-love suffer us to be such Enemies to our own good in the second, therefore this Omission of <hi>Good Works</hi> may make men think that we even question the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, and that we dream, with the <hi>Atheists,</hi> that things came together, into the excellent Order we see them in by a Conjunction that seem'd Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; and will dissolve again by a fatal necessity; &amp; though this be very rediculous, yet wiser men, in the esteem of the World, have dream'd so, than ever they were, that thought (on the supposition that there was a God &amp; he the Supream Lord of all) that we might omit this of <hi>Good Works</hi> that is most grateful to him, and the neglect whereof signifieth a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37329:29"/> Contempt of his Providence (if ever there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such.) But the holy <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath put it out of doubt, that the defect I speak of must proceed from this Cause, in that he most plainly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fers the Omission of Good Works to a conceit that there is no God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. for having said in the 1st. Verse, <hi>The Fool hath said in his Heart there is no God,</hi> it follows Ver. 3. <hi>There is none that doth good; no not one:</hi> And may we not well think, that those who will not believe there is a God, nor believe it so as to acknowledge it in the way before <hi>mentioned,</hi> &amp; that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all they see of his <hi>Goodness, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> in the Creation and Government of Heaven and Earth, shall know it to their sorrow, by what they shall feel of the manifestation of his Wrath, it may be on Earth, but certainly in Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is yet one thing more, which the Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Good Works</hi> doth seem to speak men guilty of which is worst of all, and that is their defying of Gods Power. And as this is worst, so the Evidence against them in this Case seems clearest, for altho, as I observed before, mans reason be more capable of being deluded by Atheistical thoughts then perswaded that God may be neglected if he be; yet some men think, that the <hi>invisible things of God are so clearly seen by the things he hath made,</hi> that no man can be a perfect <hi>Atheist,</hi> (however he or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may endeavour to have it so:) But then it must follow, that so far as men do believe there is a God, and that he hath Sole-Right in all things, and orders them as he pleaseth (whether they belive this willingly or necessarily) I say so far, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do such things as please him, must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the contempt of his power and to a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37329:30"/> in their Riches, as a strong Tower that will defend them against all Assaults of his Wrath and Vengeance; and that Rich men are subject to this Presumption, appears by the Direction of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, To charge them that are Rich in this world that they be not high minded nor trust in uncertain Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> And this was the very thing that the <hi>Monarch</hi> was guilty in, to whom the Council was given, in the beginning of this discourse. It seems he thought there was none above him, and that he might Rule as he pleased in despight of God; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent him to Herd with the Beasts till he should better understand that there was one <hi>Most High,</hi> that Ruleth even in the Kingdom of Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scripture hath many Instances of like kind, but but a little on each head lest I be too long. I have touched these things to show how great a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods wrath the neglect of <hi>Good Works</hi> may prove, especially when persons have a great Ability to do them, and can have no just excuse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the greatness of their Charge, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an Expence any way suitable to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, for neglect of the same.</p>
                  <p>But because Mans heart is extream hard and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid in Spirituals, and not easiely moved with the fear of God, let me stay you a little on the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>of the dreadfulness of the VVr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Ah! Sir, Had you seen the pouring out of this Wrath in the deluge of Waters that over-flowed a profligate and voluptuous world, or the pouring it down from Heaven, in Showers of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> when God over-threw the proud and lustful <hi>Soddomits,</hi> and fir'd them out of their ease &amp; sloath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37329:30"/> that was cause of those <hi>Vices;</hi> When he consumed their Riches, which being given them for <hi>Good Works,</hi> were made to minister to such abominable <hi>Lusts. Had you beheld when he made the Armys of</hi> Israel <hi>Ministers of his Wrath, and caused them with a Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Stones to over-whelm Covetous</hi> Achan <hi>and his Family, to bury them, together with their Prey which they so much loved and lusted after, within that heap, as a</hi> Memento <hi>to all hoarders of Wealth to the Worlds End: And when with Fire and Sword, they destroyed utterly so many Nations of the</hi> Amorites <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their iniquities were come to the full.</hi> Had you been among the quaking <hi>Israelites,</hi> when God descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Thunder &amp; Lightning on a burning Mountain to deliver his threatning <hi>Law,</hi> or beheld, with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed Multitude, the Sun turned into blood, the Earth trembling, the Rocks rent, the Graves opened, the dead (as affrighted) arising out of them &amp; running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy City; when the Son of God suffered on <hi>the</hi> Cross to introduce <hi>his Gracious Gospel,</hi> &amp; this, that none might think he did easiely blot out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was against us and take it out of the way by Nailing it to the Cross. Had you seen any of these, or the many more, instances recorded in Scripture of the dreadful effects of Gods Wrath, I doubt not, but it must have made such impressions on your mind, as might dispose you to flee from the wrath to come, by bringing forth fruits meet for Repentance and amendment of Life; which as I have shewed is only (in this particular Case) works of Charity and that in some proportion to past iniquities, and to present possessions. But it may be some may think, on the mention of this last instance, that though Christ had a hard Task of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37329:31"/> it, yet he hath now finished that frightful dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; Gods Justice is now satisfied, his wrath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Thunder &amp; Lightning ceased, &amp; the stormy Tempest is turned into a soft voice, and God will now accept our Faith and good wishes as sufficient tho we do no <hi>Good Works;</hi> Christ having done and suffered for us all that the Law required, tis enough that we believe in him, especially since <hi>we would do good, but evil is present with us, the flesh lusteth against the the spirit, so that we cannot do the things that we would;</hi> By such misunderstanding of the Grace of God and perverting the Text of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, men plead against the Honour of God, the interest of their own Souls, and the good of Mankind; all which (as I have shewed) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the necessity of <hi>Good Works.</hi> But, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indulgence the Gospel gives to the truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and those that faithfully endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Good VVorks;</hi> I am sure it is most severe against all Hypocrites that pretend Faith, against Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; <hi>Good VVorks</hi> both; <hi>Judas</hi> the Ring-leader of those Hypocrites, that enter'd himself Christs Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Menial Servant, only that he might steal, what he should give to the poor, had a more dreadful end, than any we read of under the Law. And so also <hi>Ananias</hi> with <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife; so blinded by Covetousness, that they thought they could cheat God Almighty as well as the Poor, were struck Dead in a moment by Gods invisible hand. And many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for some want of respect to the Poor in their Feasts of Love and in administring the Sacrament, were struck with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and weakness, yea even with Death it self. <hi>We</hi> may see in the Barren-Ground, and Fruitless Fig-Tree,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37329:31"/> what it is that hard hearted uncharitable Christians may expect from Christ, of the former he saith <hi>it is Nigh to Cursing and its end to be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> the latter <hi>he actually Cursed,</hi> so <hi>that it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withered away:</hi> and it is no wonder, for these sort of men are none of his Disciples, but are only Christians in Masquerade; when we say a man is an uncharitable Christian, we speak as great a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox as to say, he is a Drunken or a Swearing one, and some think a <hi>greater.</hi> For <hi>Love</hi> being the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all that Christ taught us whether by his Doctrine or Example; and this love to our Fellow Members being the certain sign of our love and union to himself, and made by him the very Badge of his Disciples; and Love, being vainly pretended when we neglect to releive those that are in necessity; especially when we have so great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do it: I say since it is so, it appears that none can be a true Christian or a Disciple of Christ that is thus Uncharitable: And this gives the plain reason of Christs severity against such, which is chiefly declared in that process at the last Judgment, when he is said to refuse to own them, and to send them away with that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Depart yea Cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels, for I was hungry and ye fed me not</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for in that you did it net to the least of these my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you did it not to me:</hi> And this is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Equity of that Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>If those that dispised</hi> Moses <hi>Law dyed without Mercy, of how much sorer punishment shall they be thought worthy, who tread under Foot the Son of God, and count his Blood a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing;</hi> for there are more ways of doing this than one, I mean of contemning Christ and his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37329:32"/> Blood: And it seems to me very Evident that this sin of Omission is one way of doing it; for when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the indearments of their blessed Lord, they turn a Deaf Ear to that passionate Command of his, <hi>of Loving one another, as he bath loved them all;</hi> when they will not pitty and relieve those poor distressed Creatures, that are as nearly related to Jesus Christ, as themselves can pretend to be, but will let them dye and perish, notwhithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powerful pleas which Christs dying groans, his gaping wounds, or his streaming blood, can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford in their behalf; I say such as these, may justly be thought guilty, in one respect, of Trampling on their Saviour, and undervaluing the Sacredness of his blood; and so those sorer punishments than ever <hi>Moses</hi> Law threatned become their due.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the representation of the punishment of wicked &amp; unprofitable Christians, such as tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on their Saviour in his Members, and no more regard his precious blood crying for mercy to their poor brethren, than if it were a common or unclean thing; I say the representation of Gods final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against such, is far more dreadful than any thing, which the light of Nature or Law of <hi>Moses</hi> ever discovered. The wrath of God was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven by Plagues, Deluges, Famines, and other bodily Destructions; by abandoning Men to the Devil, and to their brutish lusts; and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways among the Gentiles: And the Jews, for their disobedience ro <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, were threatned with Curses in the Basket and in the Store; in the Fruit of their Bodys and in the Fruits of their Ground; with vexation and terror of mind; with flight before their Enemies and Captivity into
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37329:32"/> strange Countrys with Consumptions and other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diseases all dreadful enough: But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, besides the continuance of all these in this Life, what the Gospel threatens at the Day of Judgment and in the life to come, we must confess the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Gods Wrath thereby to be much more dreadful than ever was revealed before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Would we but consider the dismal darkness that shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the World at the approach of the Judgment day; the Sun being darkned, the Moon turned to blood and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her light, &amp; the stars falling from heaven like the leaves of a shaken Tree.

                  <p n="3">3dly. Besides these, there are some virtues most needful in our recovery from our Fall, and for our Felicity in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miserable state of this World, which could not be at all exemplified in the pure Deity: Such as Sobriety and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, and other mortifications of the flesh, Self denial, &amp; Patience under the Cross, Meekness and Humility, Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Will of God, &amp; obedience to Death, faithfulness in the Trusts God hath committed to us, &amp; diligence in the Offices &amp; Employments he hath called us to; &amp; devotion in his holy worship and service; and such like: Never were these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented unto men with that advantage to attract their love and practice, as they were in the Life of the Holy Jesus; For if we consider him as the Wisdom and Power of God, made man to shew to sinful men the way out of a state of sin and misery to a state of holiness &amp; felicity, and that by his own example; we cannot but earnestly remark his Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and when we so know the excellent Order and exact Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servency wherein those virtues were in him, to render him the desire of all Nations, and fit him to be their teacher and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and how he makes them work in us to the healing the Distempers of our minds, regulating the disorders of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and passions, and rectifying all our words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how they are made to amend the state of the World, and to change it from a Stage of <hi>Viliny</hi> and Impiety, to a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of brave and noble Actions, from a Hellish to a Heavenly Kingdom. When we see the mighty force they have to Conquer Temptations, and destroy the works of the Devil, &amp; support us under the fears of Death; this certainly must effectually dispose us to attend to that his Law requiring these things, and to receive that spirit whereby they are so wrought and cherish'd in us. 'Tis true, our Saviour had no Original sin to be cured in himself, in which respect the effects of those virtues in him and in us do seem to differ; but if it be, as some think it is, that all <hi>the</hi> power of Original sin <hi>be</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in us, as well as the perfect Grace of God restored to us, in our Baptism; (the Grace whereof is a death unto sin and new birth to righteousness, as our Catechism teacheth) then the thing to be done by these virtues, is the same that was wrought in Christ, who was tempted in all things like as we are (tho without sin) he was made partaker of all the Natural infirmitis and Passions of our Flesh, and lived in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37329:45"/> the same wicked world, and combated with the utmost Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Subtilty and Power of Hell as we do, and yet by virtue of these graces which resided in his human nature, assisted with the Divine Spirit, he overcame all: And through him we may do so too, if we faithfully do our part.</p>
                  <p>But 4ly. However we may fail herein, if we be such as are sincere and faithful in the Baptismal Vow; and are resolved to attempt constantly and speedily, a recovery to innocency and purity, whenever we fall from it, in &amp; by the use of the other Sacrament; I say for such Christ hath obtained a <q>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, whereby they may be assured of Gods favour notwithstanding such infirmities;</q> and that we may believe he hath done this, the Gospel reveals these things following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1st. That being in the form of God and without Robbery equal to him, yet he took on himself the form of a Servant to his heavenly Father, and was made in the likeness of man: in his mysterious conception (wherein as God he was Active though as man Passive) he abhorred not the Virgins Womb, the Holy Ghost, the Power of the Highest, which proceedeth as from the Father so from the Son, came upon her, and overshadowed her, so that the holy thing that was born of her was truly called God, and the Son of God</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. His immaculate Birth, without the least stain of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or any guilt of original sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. His sinless and examplary Life, in a most industrious delightful and unwearied prosecution of the work of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and pleasing God: The unparalel, d meekness and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Death, which he suffered for the propitiating the Divine Justice, and obtaining Grace and Mercy for us: In all which he so pleased his Heavenly Father, that he could deny him nothing, at least nothing which did not infer a denyal of himself, and this Christ could not ask. Therefore whatever Favour towards man was consistent with the essential glory and purity of his Divine Nature, and no prejudice to his Wise, Just, and Supream Government of the World, this he most freely granted, as soon as our Saviour asked it of him: 'Tis true Christ could not ask pardon for the impenitent, or eternal Life for the unholy, but he asked both for such as should believe in him, and become obsignate with his holy Sacraments, because thereby they should be made penitent &amp; holy: and this God most freely gave, as what Christ had fully purchased, as that which was agreeable to his holy &amp; gracious
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37329:45"/> nature, and made for his highest glory and honor. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, so great was his Favour towards our Blessed Saviour on the Account forementioned, that he committed the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Grace into his own hands, and because it seemed but a small thing that he should be his servant, to raise up the Tribes of <hi>Jacob</hi> (those that had been formerly his people) he gave him to be a light to the Gentiles, that he might be his Salvation to the ends of the Earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.6. so that to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> he had power to give <hi>Glory, Honour, and Peace to every soul among them that worked good or did Good Works,</hi> though they failed in many things through human frailtys; and that they might be assured of this, beyond all possibility of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal doubt, he not only raised him from the dead and set him at his own Right-hand in the highest Heavens, but gave him such Gifts and Powers to bestow on all those men that would list themselves his Disciples and Followers, as astonished the World where they came, and proved his spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be from God, such as bare down before them all the Wisdom and Policy of Heathen Sages, the Power and Strength of the Kingdoms of this World, yea the very Gods of the Heathen fled before them, and all their Oracles were struck dumb by their Preaching, and who would not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit, and attend to the Law of this our Glorious head, and gracious Governour?</p>
                  <p>I shall mention but one thing more, whereby Christ hath assisted our performance of our duty, which is, The assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we have of the grateful acceptance it hath with God, and his gracious rewards for the same; and this he hath assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us of, by the exempfication of the same in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and nothing can be a greater aid and help than this</p>
                  <p>To see him, after a painful and laborious life in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all <hi>the</hi> parts of his Office, and improvement of his gifts and powers to his Fathers Honour, after patient suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the reproaches, affronts and persecutions of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies after watchings, fastings, travels, and other displeasures of the flesh; after a resolute resistance of all the Temptations of Satan, and a perfect resignation to the Will of his heavenly Father, finally after performing this latter in the hardest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance imaginable, <hi>viz.</hi> in drinking that most bitter Cup, the very fight whereof so oppressed his humanity, that <hi>his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground;</hi> I say af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, to see an Angel descend from Heaven, as Gods

                  <p>Thus you see what abundant means of Salvation those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that live within the Christian Church, and are instructed in her mysteries, so that one would think it to be impossible that <hi>Satan</hi> should ever be able to blind their minds, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their lives, and hinder their hearty Repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God. And so indeed it were, if men were not wilfully blind, and loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil; but when mens minds turn away from Gods holy Commandments, and they incline to wickedness in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37329:46"/> their hearts, the Devil, that old Serpent, will, for all this, effectually deceive them: and it must be so, except God, did not only do what is abundantly sufficient, yea so much, (as he himself saith, that nothing could be done more <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the law he had established in Nature.) But also did ordinarily work miraculously in mens Conversion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as certainly he will never do, whatever men dream.) For the Devil can set up Antichrists against Christ, and send his Ministers that shall sow <hi>Tares</hi> as fast as Christs do good <hi>Corn,</hi> he hath Mysteries of iniquity to set up against Christs Sacraments, and such as shall convey his Spirit as powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as these do the Spirit of Christ; And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And, as the amiable beauty and comfortable savour of the Divine <hi>Goodness, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence</hi> is a mighty atractive to Virgin Souls, to Love and Obedience, so to such Lustful and Adulterous minds, the gaudery and rank savour of base, foolish, and weak brutality and develisme, hath a mighty force to Captivate them &amp; oblige their servile attendance. As <hi>Christ</hi> hath obliged us by the Sacrament of his Death and Passion, <hi>who was the Lord from Heaven,</hi> to a continual suffering all earthly evils and those hardships and displeasures of the <hi>flesh</hi> contained in what we call <hi>mortification,</hi> (and this is all that is required for the preservation of that purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to which we are initiated in our Baptizm (for he that hath suffered in the <hi>flesh</hi> according to the Gospel institution, hath so far ceased from sin, and nothing but impatience of such suffering can cause any one to commit it) I say as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Christ hath obliged us to such patience as may preserve us pure &amp; as by the belief of his Resurrection which (belief is contained in the festival and Eucharistical celeberation of his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37329:47"/> passion) hath quickned us with spiritual and heavenly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such affections as make the delights and satisfactions of Grace seem to outweigh all that Nature or Flesh can desire, or <hi>Satan</hi> offer.</p>
                  <p>So the Devil by the representations he makes to the minds and fancies of men of the sensual devilish life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of most of the great Monarchs &amp; Hero's of the Earth, doth perswade them to such a continual gratification of their carnal lusts and hellish passions and the most greedy prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of worldly glory and Dominion, as is sufficiently ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to keep them in the mire and pollution of sin, and in the Communion of his cursed crue: And, by the opinion that is had of those <hi>Hero's</hi> in the world, and the <hi>Praise men give them for doing well to themselves,</hi> he <hi>doth</hi> continually beget and cherish such base desires, &amp; earthly minds, that the pleasures of a brave and heavenly life weigh nothing with them, their swill and draffe is more to those swine, than all the Jewels and Treasures that Christ offers <hi>(viz.) than</hi> all the joys of his Grace and Holy Spirit. And as the Devil can himself put on the appearance of an Angel of Light, that so he may the more effectually lead men into the regions of eternal Darkness, so he hath his Ministers that transform themselves into the Ministers of Righteousness, that so they may privily bring in Damnable Heresies, and poison men with libertine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; The sweetness whereof to carnal minds, being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with appearances of great Spirituality and outward San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity in those that preach them, make them as catching as the most infectious Plague; and, as Captains and Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of these, <hi>Satan</hi> hath set up Antichrists in the several A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church, ever since the Apostles time; of these <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> is said to be the first, who boasted himself to be the great power of God, as our Saviour is called, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his Apostles and Disciples for preheminence in working Miracles; After him followed divers that pretended some to be the Holy Ghost, some <hi>Elias,</hi> and some Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But that which is nearer to us and more concerns us is, the Consideration of him that is esteemed the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ prophesied of in the <hi>Ravelations,</hi> whom the Devil hath set up to oppose Christ, &amp; the Salvation of Men by him; This, pretending himself Christs Vicar, and offering, for money, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the worst sins, &amp; Redemption not only out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory but Hell it self, <hi>to</hi> give dispensations to common Stews, to

                  <p>Yet (for conclusion) some think his last Essay in <hi>the late</hi> times to have out-done all the former: For when the Lord Christ, had begun the destruction of that great Antichrist, by the Spirit of his mouth <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the mighty power accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the preaching his Word in the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.) And by the Brightness of his coming, <hi>viz.</hi> the convincing Demonstrations of Reason and Providence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the imposture and impiety of that Antichristian State: I say, by these, when he laid him open unto the hatred of all those that had any thing of Pity or Probity in them; then, when we might have hoped to see Christs Kingdom flourish among us, <hi>I</hi> say, then the Devil stirs up an <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that insinuates it self into some of the most Eminent of the Reformers, and Corrupts their minds with false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, about the Grace and Worship of the Gospel, about Christian Liberty, and the power of the Keys, and such like things, so that their false Doctrine in such things (assisted with a specious pretence of opposing Popery, and a Novel kind of presizness &amp; sanctity) spaun'd a Numberless Number of Sects &amp; Sectaries, weakned the force of those Truths they held in common with us, taught men how <hi>they might</hi> evade all the perswasions and Arguments, whereby they should be brought to Repentance and <hi>Good Works,</hi> &amp; finally how to talk after the Rate of the Objection I have been answering all this while, &amp; that which hath drawn me to this long Digression, but I hope, not without profit to the Reader and furtherance to my Genral Design. I shall only add, that notwithstanding all that <hi>Satan</hi> hath done or can do to hinder the Efficacy of Gods Grace and keep us in the State of Damnation, yet, if we would do what we can to put off the works of Darkness, especially that of <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>worldly mindedness</hi> and put on the Armour of Light <hi>(i. e.)</hi> apply to our Reason &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence the discoveries of Divine supernatural truth made by our Lord Jesus in his blessed Gospel) and also indue

                     <hi>Love is of God, and he that Loveth is born of God,</hi> And can God be cruel to his dear Children, that so much resemble him? No! it is impossible. His Bowels are tenderer than the most indulgent Mother, and his Compassions beyond those of the most pitiful Father; And he will be sure to <q>Do good to them that have been so good to others; with the Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37329:50"/> he always shews himself merciful; 'tis only those who have shewed no mercy that shall have Judgment without Mercy at his hands:</q> And of this the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists Prayer is as certain a Proof, as if it were a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. <q>The Lord comfort him, when he lyeth upon his sick Bed, make thou all his Bed in his Sickness;</q> and lastly there can be no greater assurance of Comfort in Death, than the Conscience of a well spent Life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another thing desireable is <hi>a Good Conscience,</hi> which is a continual Feast; This is so <hi>Evidently,</hi> as well as <hi>Naturally</hi> Consequent to this Endeavour to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Good Works,</hi> that I shall need only to mention it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The next thing that is Naturally and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably desireable, <hi>is deliverance from our Enemies;</hi> There is no man, by the greatest Justice or Goodness, can exempt <hi>himself</hi> from the hatred and enmity of evil <hi>men; the Righteous is an Abomination to the wicked:</hi> The <hi>Wise: Solomon</hi> had observed, that <hi>For Right Works Men were hated of their Neighbours,</hi> the most Eminent Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity provokes the Enmity of Niggards and Covetous men; But as God hath promised <q>that he will not deliver such into the Will of their Enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.</q> So the Love of all <hi>Good men,</hi> even of the Poor whom they have relieved, is a great security against them; <hi>For a Good Man some will even dare to die;</hi> therefore certainly such shall always find some that will dare to defend them against Caluminy and the false Reports of ill men; some to vindicate them when they are accused before their Superiors; to stand up in their defence when they are affronted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it will be very hard for ill men to do them a mischief.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37329:51"/> This is the Reason of the Wise mans Council, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.2. 'Give a Portion to seven &amp; also to eight, for thou knowest not what evil shall be on the Earth. 'Tis ten to one but that a Charitable man, among the multitude of those he obliges by his Alms, may make a Friend that may do him a kindness in ill times. Sometimes it happens, &amp; doth so very often in the Revolutions of States and Kingdoms, that those who were poor and indigent, being made Courageous by hope of advancing their fortunes, rise to Wealth and Power, when those that were wealthy, being Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminated by Sloth and Luxury, fall into Bondage and Poverty; and so it may come to be in the power of some Poor man, to recompence his Benefactors seven fold, by aiding and relieving them in such ill times wherein the Tables are thus turned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another thing desireable is the success &amp; pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of our Affairs and Undertakings; And this God hath certainly promised to the Charitable: All the Blessings in the Basket, and store in the fruit of the Body and labour of the Hands, at home and abroad, are promised to those that are <hi>obedient to Gods Law, Deut.</hi> 28. and therefore must belong to these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole Law is fullfilled in this, 'Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self, &amp; he that is exercised in doing all the Good he can to his Neighbour, is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten above the Temptations of doing him evil in any instances prohibited by that Law: <hi>Deut.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 10. 'Tis promised that if <q>we give to our Brother and be not grieved when we do so, but do it heartily &amp; chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for this the Lord will Bless us in all our works and in all that we put our hands unto. For he that giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord, &amp; he will repay him, <hi>&amp;</hi> his pay is never without great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37329:51"/> advantage, seven if not a hundred fold.</q> But even by way of Natural resultancy this follows also, for those that are given to <hi>Good Works,</hi> find so much employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Reason and Prudence in Study and Contrivances thereabout, that by exercise those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties grow most perfect, and also by such employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their minds &amp; faculties men are kept from rash &amp; expensive projects that hinder mens thriving, &amp; success in their undertakings. Charity is most contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to those two Vices that Ruin very many <hi>(viz.)</hi> Litigeousness and Gaming; Now when men are wise &amp; prudent in ordering their Offices &amp; wary of those things that divert them from their business and that waste their Estates, it is the most sure way to prosper.</p>
                  <p>Another thing desireable to all Wise men is a <hi>Good Name,</hi> which is better, in <hi>Solomons</hi> Account, than great Riches; A <hi>Good Name</hi> is always a <hi>Great Name,</hi> but not so <hi>econtra:</hi> to be famed for <hi>Greatness</hi> without Goodness, is to be counted a great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Rogue; but to be famed for <hi>Goodness</hi> in a mean &amp; poor Estate is to be counted a great Saint. The first is so because the greatest suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency cannot keep such a man from doing mischief; For there is no State of Innocency between Virtue <hi>&amp;</hi> Vice. The other is so, because the greatest penury cannot depress his Generous Mind nor hinder his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, at least as far as he is able. This <hi>Good Name</hi> doth result as Naturally from <hi>Good Works</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the Sun-Beams from the interposition of a Looking-Glass: besides God hath promised <hi>to him that hath dispersed and given to the Poor, that his Horn shall be exalted with Honour,</hi> Psal. 112.9.</p>
                  <p>Another thing very desireable, is the <hi>Love and Favour of these we converse with all,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> also values above Silver and Gold; Now 'tis easie to discern how necessary <hi>Good Works</hi> are for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37329:52"/> of this Loving Favour, and the Natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy there is in them to procure it: Every Man is a Friend to him that giveth Gifts, especially those to whom he gives in their Distress, who will have an entire Love for their Benefactors; and the esteem that every man hath of the Bravery of a Generous and Charitable disposed mind, and chiefly when it can express it self by munificence, and plentiful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributions to the Poor, will even constrain them to love such a man. <hi>Goodness</hi> is a Divine Perfection, <hi>The fair Beauty of God himself,</hi> that which attracts our desires to attend on his Worship and visit his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. The Infinitness of his Love there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, and the Gifts of his Grace there bestowed, are better than the choicest Wine, more fragrant than precious Ointments, therefore Pure Souls Love him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. and can men partake, &amp; that in eminent measures, of the same Divine perfection, and not be beloved also? that's impossible!</p>
                  <p>There are two things even beyond this Life, which for Men to hope for, while they yet live, is very desireable, and that is <q>a Blessed Memory. and a prospirous posterity:</q> And these are both most likely to be the Portion of a <hi>Good Man;</hi> for How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men may obtain a lasting memory by other things, yet, it is only those things which they do to the Benefit and Comfort of Mankind, and of those espceially that are distressed amongst them, that can procure them a <hi>Blessed Memory:</hi> And for the second, God hath undertaken that, <q>the Seed of merciful men shall be Blessed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. And that a <hi>Good Man</hi> shall leave an Inheritance to his Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that the Wealth of the sinner shall be laid up for the Just, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.22.</q>
                     <hi>(i. e.)</hi> He shall leave a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37329:52"/> lasting Estate himself to his posterity, or, if he do not, God will provide them one out of some bodys else, and most frequently he will do it of the wealth that sinners scraped together, they did not well know for whom, but God knew better: I have but touched these things because I would not tire you. And now for a conclusion shall only transcribe some Verses out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. where all those things, and more, are summed up together as encouragements to Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If thou Deal thy Bread to the Hungry, and bring the Poor, that are cast out, to thy House, and cover the Naked when thou seest him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thy Light shall break Forth as the Morning and thy Health spring forth speedily; thy Righteousness shall go before thee, &amp; the Glory of the Lord shall be thy Rere-ward: Thou shalt call, and the Lord shall answer thee, thou shalt cry, and he shall say here I am.—Thy Light shall rise in obscurity, and thy Darkness shall be as the Noon Day; The Lord shall Guide thee continually,</q> he shall satisfie thy Soul in Drought, and make fat thy Bones, and thou shalt be as a Watred Garden, and as a Spring of Water, <q>whose Waters fail not; And they that shall be of thee, shall build the old waste places, and thou shalt raise up the Foundation of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the Breach and the Restorer of paths to dwell in;</q> Certainly if men had any belief in God, or any sence of their own Felicity, such Words could not but effect in them a wonderful zeal in performing these works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>I have now only to represent how we are secured, by the practice of such <hi>Good Works,</hi> of obtaining
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37329:53"/>
                     <hi>Whatever can be hoped for in the World to come,</hi> and thereby to excite you to the same and so to conclude, and I have left this to the last as the most powerful.</p>
                  <p>The Soul of man being supposed to be immortal (as it certainly is) and that, when it is freed from all the pressures &amp; incumbrances of the Flesh, it shall be made perfect in Knowledge and Remembrance; I say, this supposed, it cannot be, but that the Soul of Man must be eternally miserable or happy <hi>after this Life,</hi> according to the dispositions, it hath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and the Works wherein it hath been employed therein. for it is impossible but that on the one hand its Radical hatred of God, and goodness, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Memory of his Sins and Follies, must be its continual Torment; and on the other hand, its Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation to God and his holy Angels, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of its Fidelity and industry in all <hi>Good Works,</hi> for it must needs compound such Joy and Filicity, as hath no measure nor end.</p>
                  <p>As the Essence of our Souls is wholly incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, so the manner of their Subsistance and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, when seperated from the Body, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no easie conception; but this is certain, that <q>they subsist in God, and operate upon him, upon themselves, &amp; upon all things that may be known, remembered or considered by them;</q> Therefore since there is a certain militation between things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they can never be happy, but in their Assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God; and when they, contemplating his most glorious perfections, can reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and behold there something of the same kind, though below his in infinite Degrees; And when also beholding the Beauty, Order, &amp; Efficacy of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, they find that themselves have been duly place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37329:53"/> therein, and have rightly operated there; <hi>(.i. e.)</hi> For the Common Good, and for their makers Glory: Again, the Remembrance of their Victory over the <hi>Infernal Powers,</hi> which having once made Schism from the Fountain of Blessedness, and disturb'd the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and order of the World, seek to bring mankind into the same Condemnation; And of their Fidelity to the Captain of their Salvation in the time of this Life, in following the Conduct of his Spirit and Law, and in improving his Aids given thereby, in seeking their own happiness, and assisting the Temporal &amp; Eternal wellfare of all their Companions, I say the remembrance of those things will Minister exceeding greatly to the Felicity of the separate Soul: Besides we may imagine that the Soul by being imployed in this World in the practice of <hi>Good Works,</hi> had contracted a disposition to Admire, Love &amp; Honour, all that were Eminently perfect in the same practice, as we see it is in all the Arts &amp; Actions of humane Life; Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners in all Arts and Exercises, Love and Honour, those that are Masters in the same. Now, when a soul▪ so disposed comes to have Communion with the Father of Goodness, who filled Heaven <hi>&amp;</hi> Earth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched all his works with the Treasures of his Mercy and Bounty; when these Souls shall behold the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body of Christ, (for Spirits can see Bodys, though not, <hi>econtra</hi>) I say that Body of Christ which was the Treasurie of the Divine Goodness, as well as Wisdom, in which <hi>dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead Bodily</hi> and whence, the Deity dispearsed Gifts of Grace and Offers of his Eternal Glory to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that with mighty Advantage: When we shall feel in our Souls the further tho not final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of that Mystery, which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> break into admiration, and with a seeming abruptness to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37329:54"/> say, <hi>This is a great Mistery, but I speak concerning Christ and the Church,</hi> Eph. 5.32. The Mistery of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction unto Christ, which shall make us to be one Spirit with our Lord, as he had been one Flesh with us; When <hi>That Spirit whom the Lord is,</hi> (2 Cor. 3.17.) both as our Creator and Saviour shall have effected <hi>the cleansing and sanctifying us, as to our Souls, that we shall in Soul be presented to himself, Glorious, Holy, and without Blemish, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any such thing:</hi> And shall dwell in us as we in him, and be as it were the Soul of our Souls, and form them to the likeness of the Eternal mind, which is Love and Goodness it self: When it shall affect them with the same passions; that possessed the most perfect, pure, amorous Soul of our Blessed Saviour; when this participation of the Spirit of Christ, shall <hi>unite</hi> all Saints into one <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>the</hi> participation of his <hi>Flesh</hi> in the blessed Sacrament united us all into one Body; When, thus united, they shall communicate the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights they had in doing <hi>Good Works</hi> in this World, and every one shall enjoy the Felicity of all, when they shall love and admire, praise and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate each others brave and generous Actions, their free &amp; charitable Distributions, &amp; then shall all joyn in a <hi>Chorus</hi> to Adore the Father of Mercy, the Fountain of their <hi>Good Affections</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> who wrought in them to will and to do: When they shall thus live in the Love and Embraces of God, of Christ, and of each other, and in the continual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of Joy and Praise, I say, when I consider this happy State, I cannot tell what there is for the Soul of Man, thus considered as in the State of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Body, to desire or hope for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; And I think also, that none that considers how
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37329:54"/> natural it is for <hi>Good Works</hi> to beget such Dispositions, and how necessary the happiness of the soul so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed must be, in such its Conjunction and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as I have before mentioned, <hi>I</hi> say, no such will <hi>I</hi> hope Condemn what I write as having any thing false, or very doubtful in it: But <hi>I</hi> will proceed to something plainer.</p>
                  <p>It was not only the Soul, but the Body, that was imployed in <hi>Good Works</hi> here, and therefore, That must partake of the Reward hereafter. 'Tis true, Reason never discovered any thing or very little of the Resurrection of the Body untill it was helped therein by Divine Revelation; But reason having once conceived that God will raise our Bodys, and unite them again to the glorified immortal Soul, it can easiely conclude that they shall be so qualified as becomes that Union; and that <hi>there</hi> shall be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy, between the Felicity of the Body, and the highest perfection of the Soul, as it was here; yea that it shall, not only consist with it, but be adjuvant thereunto; Those Eyes, that ministred unto the Souls Goodness here, by observing the wants and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Poor, and affecting it with their Miseries, shall minister to its Blessedness there, by beholding the visible manifestations of Gods invisible▪ perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in such discoveries, as shall there be made, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding what was ever made by this lower Creation, or by any thing therein: In beholding the glorified Body of Christ and <hi>those</hi> of all his Saints, which shall shine with unconceiveable Beauty and Splendour in the Eyes of our own glorified Bodys, and thereby affect our perfected Souls.

                  <p>The Feet that often had Travelled to visit the afflicted or imprisoned, and been wearied (like those of their Lord) in seeking occasions for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries of Piety and Charity, these shall be enabled to Minister to the soul in curious measures and variety of interchanges <hi>Whilst it danceth for Joy, when in its songs it praiseth the most High,</hi> Psal. 28. In brief howsoever we can imagine that a most beautiful and active body, may minister to a most virtuous and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed soul in the State of Glory, so, and much more, shall it be with them at the Resurrection of the dead.</p>
                  <p>But as there is a particular Judgment passed on each soul at its departure out of the Body, and then it is conveyed by Good or Evil Angels to its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place to receive the beginnings of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Punishment; so there is also a general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when both soul and body reunited, shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at Gods Tribunal, to receive according to what they have done here, whether it be Good or Evil; some mens Works indeed go before to Judgment, &amp; some follow after, but all mens works must be there produced; Those that have been so Eminent in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Charity, that all believed them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37329:55"/> Saints, these shall 'tis like, be caught up to meet Christ in the Clouds, and come with him in Triumph to judge the World; but those that have been of more imperfect and doubtful Piety shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a severer Tryal; But at last a perfect distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be made between the Sheep and the Goats, and all prepared to receive the final sentence; In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing whereof the greater Reason of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is assigned, Ye fed me, or ye fed me not, ye cloathed me, or ye cloathed me not; Because this was the only real and certain proof of our Faith in Christ, and Hope of Gods Mercy through him, <hi>viz.</hi> that we obeyed the Evangelical precepts of Love &amp; Charity, and imitated our blessed Saviour in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof, that we extended the same mercy to men, that we hoped from God; And as without this, no man can reasonably expect to be believed when he professeth to be a Christian, so according to this he must acknowledge himself to be justly judged, at the last Day.</p>
                  <p>Let us now consider the preparations for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this Blessed Company, who were counted worthy to escape all the Horrors and Miserys of the Damned, and to stand before the son of Man in the Heavenly Kingdom: Here are Mansions, many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, so many that every one may possess more than the Wealthiest and Noblest on Earth ever enjoyed; There are Crowns and Palmes, Robes &amp; Thrones, a most glorious City, and most fruitful Paradice, the most blessed Company, the most perfect security, the highest Delights, and most perfect Appetites; unmixed joys, undisturbed peace, unspeakable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; no measure, no end of Felicity, my words fall infinitely short, my fancy fails me, in representing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37329:56"/> these preparations our Saviour tells us; that Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive, the things that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, even in this World, for them that Love him, but much] less in That; and therefore, though the Scriptures abound in speaking glorious things of these preparations, <hi>I</hi> shall add no more, but only I must remember you that 'tis to <hi>him that overcometh &amp; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christs Works,</hi> that all this is promised, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26. and that where men yield to base covetous affections, and refuse the practice of <hi>Good Works,</hi> they will but cheat themselves by the most pleasant conceits of Heavenly Joys; and <hi>I</hi> should but cheat you neither, if I could Rap you into the greatest extasie of such delights by a Rhetorical description of the Glory of the heavenly Habitations, and not frequently mind you what is of Absolute Necessity, to your Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereinto.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore, most earnestly intreat you to enlarge these things in your most serious Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then think thus with your self seriously and devoutly, <hi>Lord! who would not make all the Friends he could of this Mammon of Ʋnrighteousness, that when he fails, he may be surely, as joyfully, and gloriously receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into those Everlasting Habitations,</hi> and that you may do so, and to help you therein, let me begg your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a little, while <hi>I</hi> suggest to you, who those Friends may be, that we should make to that purpose, and shew how they may be so made yours.</p>
                  <p>Those by whose Favour our Entrance into the Heavenly Joys may be infallibly secured, and by whose Aid the Circumstances of that admittance may be greatly improved to our Joy &amp; Glory, are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                  <p>First <hi>then for the</hi> Blessed Trinity: These three in one, and one in three are the first and chief of those Friends which it becomes us to make for securing our reception into everlasting Habitations, and they will only be made such by our well using those Riches, that most men use to ill purposes (on which account they are called <hi>The Mammon of Ʋnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>). The infinite Powers and Perfections of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity are as its Riches, and these God useth to the Good of all his Creatures; whatever therefore may be called our Riches God expects we should use to the Good of our Neigbours after his own example; and that we should do it with the same freedom and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness as we use them for the Good of our <hi>own selves, and if we do so we shall approve our selves his</hi> Children, begotten of his Grace in Christ Jesus, and shall be acknowledged by him to be Heirs of his Glory; And, as such, received with Joy and Triumph into the Everlasting Habitations.</p>
                  <p>But because this is a most weighty matter, and some discourse thereon may very much farther, both your readiness to use well your riches (which to do contains in it all the <hi>Good Works I</hi> provoke you unto) and also your conceiving a lively hope of <hi>that reward</hi> which is the great incentive unto the same, <hi>I</hi> will make this my last Digression, and will treat somewhat more largely on this Head than the Laws of Method will allow.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>God over all, blessed for ever more</hi> can be but one▪ For as there can be but one Infinite, &amp; Almighty, one First and Best, one Supream and Highest, one <hi>Immense</hi> and Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Essence; But one absolute &amp; intire perfection, so there can he but one that is Self-sufficient and Self-satisfying in this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Blessedness and Felicity. God is the Father of lights; All beatitude is radically in him, and is generated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him, he hath made this World capable of giving &amp; us capable of receiving therein a Temporal Felicity; But he hath prepared a world to come, that shall give us an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting State of Felicity, &amp; is preparing us, by more enlarged cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, to receive it, and will at last bring us to the most assured enjoyment thereof. The first Discovery &amp; Revelation of this eternal Felicity was from him alone; Reason could never have reached it: And that final Possession we hope to have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, must be so also; For, as from the Father of lights we have received many good and perfect gifts in order to encourage and perswade our Repentance and doing <hi>Good Works</hi> in this World, So, if we be perswaded thereby to repent &amp; to do <hi>Good Works</hi> here, we shall certainly receive from him that which is called <hi>The gift of God</hi> with a special emphasies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23 when he receives us into those Everlasting Habitations,</p>
                  <p>This DEITY <hi>The Father of mercy and God of all consolation, even that which reacheth to all Eternity,</hi> I say, this Eternal Unity must be conceived by us as subsisting in Trinity. We can have no proper and immediate conceptions of God, but must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him by way of analogy &amp; proportion to other things, &amp; so he speaks of <hi>himself</hi> in all Divine Revelations: The end of all his Works is to Reveal him to us in such manner as 'tis best &amp; easiest for us to know him. All things in the World sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in a Trinity of first and chief principals; as doth the first matter whereof they were made; and to demonstrate this of the latter will give probability to the former, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall be briefly touched here. The matter of all that God Created in the beginning, is expressed <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. by two Words, <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> the first is the Mother of all material Being
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37329:58"/> the last of those which were made of Matter.

In the material part of the World men count four Elements, but <hi>I</hi> conceive, with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, there are but three. For 'tis impossible for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> differ so much, or rather, are so to be distinguished, as Water and Fire are, or that there is not as great a difference between Glass, which it but Earth purified, and Clay, which is Earth commixed, as there is between <hi>Air,</hi> which is <hi>Water</hi> rarified, &amp; <hi>Water,</hi> which is Air, condens'd.

Which neither we cannot know, but by analogy unto that which is in our selves. The 3d. is the <hi>Properties and Actings of this life,</hi> and this is most notionable of the three; as nearest to us, and most resembled in our Souls.

In the material part of the World▪ <hi>Earth</hi> is that out of which Fire and Water is produced and in which Originally they were contained, and therefore, God <hi>is</hi> said in the begining to make the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the other two in that.

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:37329:58"/> the second instance. The Power of willing must be first, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and apt to produce <hi>Knowledge▪</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> as I have shewed before, and as having the greatest Eminency in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane consideration: <hi>VVe will to know, and will to do:</hi> To <hi>know</hi> first, and then from <hi>will</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> proceeds <hi>Action.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> is the Supream Empress of all Spiritual Powers, &amp; the indowments thereof are most excellent among all Moral perfections: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must think of the Essence and Perfections of Deity, as subsisting in a Trinity, or not think of it, at all; Because all things whereby God is manifested do so subsist, and especially our own Souls (of which before.). Supernatural Revelations speak of God, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three distinct persons in one undevided Essence. Now it is Evident that in the Supereminency of the Divine Being, <hi>Father, Son &amp; Spirit,</hi> do not signifie the very same as they do with Relation to our selves, nor doth <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Procession</hi> neither; But something there is, that we can no better know, nor otherwise express; and he that is humble and modest will not cavel with words which he cannot mend, nor refuse to speak as God himself speak; And as those direct who are his Ministers, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To UNITY of Deity, multiplicity of Gods is contrary, &amp; so is any thing that hath diversity and contrariety in our conception of its Being; But 'tis not so, to distinguish of Personality and personal Properties and Subsistencies with their mutual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or however the thing may be expressed which is but to signifie our apprehension of the order of Being and Operation in that incomprehensible Essence from something we know in our selves, or other things.</p>
                  <p>In the Ever Blessed TRINITY, The Father being first, and the Fountain of Deity, and the Son and Spirit subsisting Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in him, receiving their Nature and Power and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and whatever they have eternally from him, and oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in and upon all things, according to his eternal purpose &amp; decree. The whole Trinity therefore from him is called the eternal Father, <hi>&amp;</hi> so they altogether, are in perfect equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as relating unto things without themselves; The destinction
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37329:59"/> being principally as we conceive the Relation that the Divine persons have to each other; in the Divine Essence it self, and in other their operations in the work of our Salvation; And it may be if God had subsisted only in the pure Deity to all Eternity, as from all Eternity he did, before the incarnation of our Lord, we had not heard of a distinction of persons, of first Principles or Primalities in the Deity or God-head, unless from the Schools of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> where it was long before Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty came into the World, and is still discours'd of without Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Divine Revelation.</p>
                  <p>But since GOD hath been in Christ Reconciling the World to himself: The <hi>Deity</hi> is spoken of in Evangelical Revelations, As Related to <hi>Emanuel</hi> God in Humane Nature; And therefore the analogy between what we speak of God and our Selves, is here greater, &amp; so we may more properly express hereby that which we apprehend concerning the Manner of the Divine Subsistence and operations, Especially as with Relation to the great work of bringing us unto those everlasting Habitations both in Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>It is Evident, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as first in that incomprehensible Unity, hath the name of <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Father,</hi> most frequently ascribed unto him, &amp; as such is to be addressed by us in all sacred Offices, &amp; that the Gospel doth require the same; For the other persons are here considered as Ministring to Deity in this wonderful work. Christ Jesus is said to be Gods Servant, his Elect one, the Messenger of his Covenant, sent to confirm and fulfill the promises made to the Fathers; He is Gods great Embassador to us, and our migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Advocate with God. The Holy Ghost, He is Gods gift and Christs witness to the World; Gods Advocate in us and our Paraclete with him, <hi>He who maketh intercession for the Saints according to the Will of God,</hi> Rom. 8.34. And therefore as the Name <hi>Parson</hi> which is predicated of the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. may also be properly spoken of the Son and Holy Gost without prejudicing our Respects to the glory of the indivisible Unity of Deity, so neither doth the glory we give to the Father, as the Fountain of Deity, And, in this Unity, the greatest as well as the first, make his glory unequal to that of the Son or Holy Ghost, or his Majesty more Eternal than theirs, Nor do the Offices which we ascribe <hi>to the Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> as received <hi>from the Father,</hi> at all diminish <hi>that their Divine Glory</hi> which they have in Common with him; Only it is needful, for instructing the

I say, if it had been so, it can never enter into the <hi>imaginations</hi> of man that this would have allured his mind to employ it self in the Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God in inquiries into his Glorious Perfections and wonderful works, or at least, not comparable so much, as when Deity is become one with us in such an incomprehensible Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Now the very same person is both God &amp; Man; When, in Christ, he hath so humbled himself to exalt us, emptied himself to fill us, cloathed himself with Flesh, &amp; submitted, yea, desired to be lift up upon the Cross, and then made <hi>This</hi> his Call to us, <hi>Behold me, behold me, was ever sorrow like mine? Look unto me and be saved all ye ends of the Earth:</hi> and so I might proceed: But it is manifest to all within the Pale of the Church whose Eyes <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> hath not blinded, that the Representations that God hath made of himself in Christ, are the most attracting, most satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, most ravishing, that can possibly be imagined, &amp; that <hi>this is Life Eternal</hi> (not only in preparation but prelibation) <hi>To know him the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent,</hi> and the mind that feeds on the Flesh and Blood of Jesus Christ, as God is manifest therein, &amp; hath a right belief &amp; affectionate Cogitation hereof, while his Body as broken &amp; his Blood as shed, is exhibited in the Blessed Sacrament; That mind I say▪ hath the beginning of Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 6.54. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, there is as great difference, as to the Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereof, in Receiving this Sacrament as the Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Flesh and Blood of a Creature (tho never so great) and that, of receiving it as <hi>The Flesh and Blood of the Eternal Son of God, Ʋery God of Ʋery God, as there</hi> is between finite &amp; infinite; Therefore I conclude, that as to them that rightly understand this Mistery all things are counted but as Dung and Dross in Comparison of the excellent Knowledge of it, So it is in it self so exceedingly attracting to the Eyes of our mind, That, if they could but once be turned away from beholding these worldly Vanities on which they are so intently fixed; there would need no more o perswade our frequent attendance on the Representation and Contemplation of this Mistery, than its own exceeding Sweetness. For the second, Whatever men may dispute of the Soveraign Power, Liberty, and Freedom, which God hath to save us, being so guilty as aforesaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any satisfaction; Yet it can never enter into the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any man, how such a dread and awe of this Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and fear of doing against his Soveraign Will and Pleasure, should be effected in us, I say in us, so set on do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

When the Eternal Father, that must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have such infinite Love for this his son, (as only E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally begotten of him; And now, in the fullness of time, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in humane Nature, His only begotten also by Miraculous Generation) yet was pleased to lay on him the sins of the whole World, to bruise him and put him to grief, to make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto men as striken, smitten of God and afflicted, and unto himself as utterly forsaken of his Heavenly Father, and ready to sink into a horror and dispair: This! above all that can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, must work a dread of sin, and effect the mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
                  <p>Besides thirdly, tho it became the infinite Goodness to pitty miserable man and incline to save him, and the Wisdom of God to contrive a way for it, and the Power of God to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it self in effecting it, yet it can never enter into the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of any man, that, so long as God did <hi>Will</hi> himself, <hi>Know</hi> himself, and <hi>Love</hi> himself, as aforesaid, I say, that ever he should be so Regardless of his own glory as to give it to a Creature, how great soever (no not altho it were possible for such a one to be capable of all the great Titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37329:61"/> in Scripture to Christ as God man (which I shall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Creature can be, till it be proved that finite can receive that which is infinite, that which is Circumscriptable can be Omnipresent, &amp; that which cannot sustain it self be Omnipotent, and more such contradictions) and indeed the greater such a Creature is conceived to be, the more difficult would it be to reconcile <hi>That great zeal which God must have for his Divine Glory,</hi> (if Reason or Scripture be to be believed) with his infinite munificence in raising that Creature to such high Dignity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is worshiped and adored with the very same Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with God himself, and especially if we ascribe to that Creature a free undertakeing such dreadful sufferings for our Salvation, &amp; believe, that in reward whereof he received the fullness of Divine Power, and that (whatever Right God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to himself, yet) he hath it in present possession and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and that he can reward and punish us at his pleasure; &amp; finally, if we ascribe to him the power I am speaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> A power to shut us out of the Everlasting Habitations of Bliss and Glory, or at Pleasure to receive us into the same; For then, it being most likely that all men would Love and Honour, Worship and Adore him that is so their Saviour, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor and Soveraign Judge; more than the Most High himself, God may be thought most regardless of himself; which it utterly impossible he should be; And therefore I must believe that <hi>Infinite and Active Love</hi> proceeding from the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Deity in itself &amp; from the eternal Knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of its own Perfections, could not but incline rather to unite the Nature of Man unto Deity, and to take it into the highest Communion therewith, than to grant that those Honors which seem to mankind to belong only to the most high God, should be given unto an exalted Creature: And I believe this,, because by the former, altho the greatest Honour be bestowed on <hi>humanity,</hi> yet nothing doth so much as seem detracted from the adoration and worship of Deity. But by the latter, altho we say that such a Creature is not the most high God, but is only a great and mighty Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37329:62"/> Therefore 'tis infinitely easier for me to believe, That the Deity did so inhabit Humanity, as that God, and Man being one person, what is proper to Deity is ascribed to Humanity, and that which is proper to Humanity is ascribed to God, then to believe that the most high God should Create <hi>One,</hi> who should be called <hi>God over all, Blessed for ever more,</hi> the 'Word and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his Power by whom he made all things; And the very same Names, Titles, Attributes, Propertys, and Works, ascribed to him as to the Most High himself, that the same Worship and Reverence should be required of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven, Earth, &amp; Hell towards him as to the God that made him: That he should call himself GOD, which none of those on whom God put that Tittle ever did, but by instigation of the Devil; that he should claim an <hi>Equality with God</hi> in all things as being <hi>One with him, One,</hi> not only in will (as all Angels and Good men are) but in Essence, so that, <hi>See one and you see both, what one doth both do;</hi> and much more that might be said to this purpose; And that God should send thus Creatures to take Humane Nature, and should, both by his Miraculous Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mighty works and Equal Command of his Holy Spirit (which indeed they say is but a singular Angel) bespeak a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for him in the world, where he preached himself the Son of God and his Equal; and should, by his Death, Resurrection and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, call the world to his worship, and that far more loudly than ever he called <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Caldea,</hi> or his <hi>Seeds</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to serve himself. But if any man yet think this is not Reason enough for my believing the former before the latter, let him read yet farther.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By believing that Jesus Christ was the second in that Eternal Trinity wherein the most high &amp; only true God doth subsist, we must conceive a far more strong and stedfast hope of mercy and pardon (if we shall Return to God) than by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as some do) that he was an inferiour God, made of the first-born of Creatures: For that it must be more effectual here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for God himself to descend, &amp; preach Repentance, to take a body, that he might suffer for our sins, to be tempted like as we are in all things that he might succor all tempted persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than if he had sent the most exalted Creature to do so: The <hi>Word</hi> of God being more Powerful, the <hi>Blood</hi> of God more precious, than that of a Creatute; And the same <hi>blood</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered by the Eternal Spirit, as Conceived Third in that Blessed Trinity, &amp; as proceeding from the Eternal Father who is
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:37329:62"/> Love itself, and the Eternal Son who is Wisdom it self, being much more effectual to beget in us a hope that God will receive all penitent sinners, than if it had been offered by a Spirit that is but a chief Angel &amp; not God himself; For it would be difficult for us to hope, that the short sufferings of a finite Creature, could he a full, perfect sufficient Sacrifice, Oblation, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the sins of the whole world, from the beginning of it to the End; And if it should fall short in the least it impares the hope of mercy and pardon in every man; And so sensible of this are the opposers of our Doctrine of the Trinity, that they deny, that there is any need at all of a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the remission of sins; Altho in this they say against the common sence of all mankind; against the signification of many Tipes and Figures under the Law; and against plainest Texts of Scripture, Texts so plain that they cannot be evaded but with such Sophistry, as, being allowed, would make all Speech and Writings utterly unintelligable. But of this, as also of the fifth and sixth Head, I have spoken of before, <hi>Page</hi> 72. and so forward, But I shall add here a little more.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Conception of God as subsisting and operate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before said, and that, both eternally in himself, and in Christ Jesus in the fulness of time, is incomparably more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to make us most dearly to Love &amp; Honour him, than if we conceive of him without Relation to any such subsistence &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, or then if we conceive of him as not so subsisting, &amp; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as operating in the Creation of another mighty God, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of a chief Angel or Spirit, first as his own Minister and Messenger, and then in giving the same Spirit to the God aforesaid to be his Spirit and Apostle to be employed by him, in Creating and Governing the world and in gathering and rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, but this under the most high God. <hi>This</hi> thing to me, is very Evident, and therefore, lest I digress too far I shall only recommend it as a Subject worthy most serious Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and say no more of it here.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Eternal Deity as subsisting in it self in a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of first principles, operating within it self as before, is the Prototipe and Samplar of a perfected mind, <hi>viz.</hi> a mind acting &amp; operating Regularly and Virtuously: Gods willing, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and loving himself, as perfectly good, wise, and active in doing good to all his Creatures, teacheth how we should will, know, and love our selves. The same God, conceived as being in Christ reconciling the world to himself, teacheth how we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37329:63"/> should be affected to others, especially those that are frail &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, first seeking their Salvation, &amp; when converted &amp; reformed, what Complacency &amp; delight we should have in them, &amp; how we should imbrace &amp; serve them with a perfect heart. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to conceive that the <hi>Novel</hi> &amp; <hi>Heterodox</hi> Representations some make of a Trinity, That, into the belief and service of which they suppose we are Baptized, I say that this should have such effect on us, (or at least have it with that Efficacy) as That Representation of the Trinity which is Antient and Orthodox will have. To conceive one most high God, and one great and mighty God, as made by him; and a principal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit chosen by them both to be sent on their Errands, can never work so to right forming our minds or Reforming our lives as the Conception of one God subsisting and operating as aforesaid will do: And if they can pretend to any such thing let them shew it, and it shall have an Answer, if not, they must know that such belief in God as makes us most good, must certainly be acknowledged to be truest and best, and if they know not this they are wilfully blind.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The belief of this mistery will cause us exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to Exult in the kindness and love of God towards us.</p>
                  <p>God being, by the Holiness of his Nature, greatly averted from us by Reason of our sins; and the Sanctions of his Law and ends of his Righteous Government obliging him to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us, &amp; that in some proportion to his own greatness, &amp; also unto the heinousness of our sins, which to do, he knew would Eternally Ruin us, <hi>I</hi> say in this Case, it was exceeding great Love and Kindness in the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness inclined him and his Wisdom advised him to save us: but when the way, in which this infinite Wisdom saw it must be done, had great difficultys in it, so great, as that, while we conceive of this most high God by way of analogy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our selves, we must apprehend in him an infinite Reluctancy against it, than to believe he did so for all that, this will affect us with great exultancy and admiration. If we should conceive of a most Merciful, Holy, &amp; Righteous Prince as having but one only dear and most dutiful Son, and this Prince as being highly provoked by his Rebellious Subjects, and obliged, by such Reasons as before said, to punish them to their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>struction; But yet that he was of so merciful a Nature that he Should yet incline to save them; think we then that on Consultation with his own &amp; the publick Wisdom he found
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37329:63"/> it could not be done, but by putting that his dear and only Son in place of those his Rebellious Subjects, and by shewing the same angry Countenance toward him, and by Executing the same punishments upon him (at least for a time) as if he were one of the worst of the Rebels; Can any man think now, that this Princes Bowels would not turn within him at the Motion, That his Relentings to his Son would not so kindle in his Breast as to consume all his former Compassions to his Subjects, and set his heart against them to their Remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Destruction; And might it not be a sufficient Plea against his own Relentings or their murmurings that they have made their Salvation impracticable but in such a Method as none can hope he would take. But could we yet think him so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as, considering the multitude of his Subjects, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to save them this way which is so much against his own Natural Affections: Could we then suppose such a Son to be so wise, that, considering it would be an Eternal Honour to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, his Father, his King, and himself, freely to undertake this hard task for the Salvation of those Rebels, and that it would for ever oblige them to be the best Subjects in the World, and to fall at his Feet, and lament their former Baseness and to offer themselves a Sacrifice to his Honour and Service; Could we a so suppose this Son so Brave that he did now actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and most freely offer himself to serve the most gracious inclinations of that Prince his Father towards his Rebellious Subjects, and most wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ingly to do, and suffer whatever should seem necessary in the Case; Yet then we must conceive that all this would but increase the Love of this his Father towards him, as so wise and brave a Son; and, how great soever his Compassions to his Subjects might be, he must be supposed to feel infinite Reluctancies within himself, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of what this his Son must do and suffer for them; Now in this Case to depress his Natural Affections and all Fatherly Compassions so far, as to resolve and purpose so to do; And finally so as to proceed to accomplish it, must be the highest Expression of Love and Compassion that ever can enter into imagination of man; And since we conceive of God in analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to our selves (as I said) we must conceive <hi>him</hi> to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit in his Loving kindness towards us, when, notwithstanding his Love to his dear and only Son Jesus Christ our Saviour, infinitely wise and good as himself, yet his Active Power pressed forward, resolvedly to effect this astonishing thing,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37329:64"/>
                     <hi>not to spare his own and only begotten Son, most dearly beloved of him, but give him up to Death for us;</hi> and hence we may exult in the assurance of Gods Future Love and Kindness <q>how shall he not with him freely give us all things, as doth the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31.32.</q> No man can be so stupid as to think there is any Comparison between such Love as this, and that which might only move the most high to give leave to a Creature (tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great) to appear in form of a man and to suffer death on the Cross; Especially when he was to appear with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Messia</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> of God, and to suffer with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thnt he should be soon raised and exalted to a Dignity equal to that of God himself: Alass! what delusion should make men forme such a Comparison; we can easiely imagin that it is an infinite Condescention for the invisible, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, most adoreable and impassable Majesty of Heaven and Earth, I say for Him so to unite himself to humanity, as that, it becoming the same person with himself, he may be said to be visible, to be inclosed in the Womb, to be Scorned, Reviled and Blasphemed to his very Face, &amp; to suffer a painful, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death, when yet, by all this, nothing can possibly be acquired to the increase of his Divine Felicity or Glory, but all redounds to our Humanity alone. But we cannot easiely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any great Condescention, much less so great, if a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (tho of a Super-Angelic Nature) should do all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid; Because there would so much encrease of Honour and Glory accrue to him thereby, that it would be valuable unto the utmost of his diminishing himself, and suffering the worst Death imaginable, yet it would be so so far above it, that we may think, first That the most high could not so forget he was God as to permit it. Nor secondly Any Creature but Lucifer himself should aspire thereunto.</p>
                  <p>For the first, The most high so often calling himself our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Redeemer and Saviour and Exulting in that Name, as much as in the Name of God himself, having often protested against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others being so, and said that he knows not any, nor will have us to know or acknoweldge any such; that as there was no such formed before him, so none shall be formed after him, for which you may consult the 41. 43, 54. Chapters of <hi>Isa.</hi> and <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.3. and many more places, <hi>I</hi> say it is incredible now, that God should make another God after himself to be our Lord, Redeemer and only Saviour, and to be worshiped and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all men as such.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:37329:64"/>
                  <p>Nor can any thing be imagined of greater Insolency than for a Creature to aspire to the tremulous Attributes and Glory of the Great Jehovah, and arrogate to himself the indearing, Titles of their God and Saviour, their Life and Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby Mankind would be attracted to Worship him more than the Supream Creator himself. Therefore while we cannot apprehend that the Most High should give, or any Creature (that knows its distance) ask or receive such Honours, how can we exult in the Love of God, or of Christ, considered but as a Creature.</p>
                  <p>The belief of this Mystery will excite our Endeavours after the Heavenly Kingdom above, to behold that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Glory of our Humanity which must be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent unto its incomprehendible Union with Deity in Christ, and to receive from him the Communications of the same Glory according to our measure; to Reign and be Enthroned with him among the Glorious Company of Heaven, to sit together at the great Festival above, and to have the Son of God Cloathed with our Nature, to come forth and serve us; such things as these will make Men desirous of Heaven, if they have not destroyed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in themselves. 'Tis impossible indeed for the Soul, while cloathed with Flesh, to conceive, explicitly what those Enjoyments are which we shall have of God, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the pure Deity, or of those meer and pure Spirits which do resemble him in that his Subsistence: But we can better conceive the Enjoyment of God, when mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Glory of Christs Humanity, and when he shall be Glorified in all those his Saints which are Members of his Body. <q>We read in the 21 &amp; 22 of the <hi>Revelations</hi> of that Manifestation and Enjoyment of God, whereby we shall be made happy in the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it; that the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb was the Light thereof. That a River of pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of Life proceeds from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb; on each side of which grows the Tree of Life. That no Curse shall be there, because the Throne of God and of the Lamb are in it;</q> which shews that our Blessed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37329:65"/> Saviour, even according to his Humane Nature (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to which he is called the <hi>Lamb</hi>) shall, in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Almighty, be the Head and Fountain of our Eternal Felicity in the Everlasting Habitations.</p>
                  <p>But the belief of this depends chiefly on the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs being God, and so of the Glory of the whole Trinity (which is unseparable) shining on us through the Vale of his Humanity. Those that hold that Christ is but a made God, have odd conceits of that his delivering up his Kingdom to the Father, when he shall have put down all Rule and Authority under his Feet; spoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. whereas this truly signifies but the greater assurance of that Glory. The Kingdom of Christ in this World, is the reign of Grace through Righteousness unto Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. and that Righteousness was wrought first by himself, when, in his state of Humiliation, by his Patience under all Sufferings; and by the death of the Cross he purged our sins, before he sat down on the Right Hand of the Majesty on High; and secundarily it is wrought, by his Spirit, in all his Members, when they are made <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Kingdom and Patience</hi> under their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Flesh, which are to precede their sitting down with him, and ceasing from sin and punishment for ever; to fulfill the Righteousness of this Kingdom. Christ was Baptized as our Head, and we as his Members; and the Obligation of his Baptism he answered, when by his death he overcame him that had the power of Death, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the fear of it, by taking away the sin of the World (which was its Sting) thus he triumphed on the Cross; and ours we answer when we Reign over the Malice of Men and Devils, and subdue the World by Faith and Patience. Men may talk of a <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> of Christs Worldly Reign, which is of a quite different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from this, and proudly call themselves the Saints that are to govern the Wicked (such they think all Christians to be that are against their way.) But this Spirit, whether working in <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> is not the Spirit of Christ, which in Form of a Dove descended on him at his Baptism, and which he communicates in ours. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of that

                  <p>But when all Enemies by this means are destroyed, and the Deity perfectly reconciled to our Humanity in Christ and all his Members, when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of Jehovah, in which all our Sins shall be blotted out; then shall the Deity be most conspicuous in the Government of this Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, this Blessed Company who shall be Kings and Priests to God and Reign with Christ for ever; not now, by subduing things grievous through the power of Faith and Patience; but by exulting in our Victory over the Devil and Death, and in having obtained the Crown of Eternal Life. And as Christ was Head and Chief in that Kingdom and Patience whereof all his Saints are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers here, so shall he be there in the Joy and Glory of that Kingdom for which he suffered; And our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be with him as Man, but from him as God, the second in that Eternal Trinity, whereof the Father is First and Chief, to whom therefore the Kingdom is said to be delivered. I confess this matter needs more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but I must not inlarge.</p>
                  <p>These things I have touched, to shew the blessed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a Belief in the Trinity, as manifested in Christ for the Salvation of the World, the Excellency and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of which Mystery is such, that the Blessed Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to be in Labour for words to express it; he calls it the <hi>exceeding, abounding, unsearchable</hi> Riches of Gods Grace, the <hi>Riches of the Glory</hi> of the Mystery of Christ; therefore I shall return where I left, <hi>page</hi> 103. a little farther explain this, and so end this Digression.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:37329:66"/>
                  <p>The Apostle calls it the Mystery of <hi>God</hi> and of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi> which may be the Mystery of <hi>God</hi> as subsisting (in Trinity in Unity) in the pure Deity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of the Father is the Fountain, and as subsisting and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in our Humanity where Christ is so; in the first God was manifest as our Creator, in the second as our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>I said that from the Trinity, as subsisting in the pure Deity, man by reason of sin is become incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received into the Everlasting Habitations of Bliss and Glory; but that it became the dreadful Majesty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, whom we had offended by our Sin, yet in mid'st of his infinite Blessedness to pity the misery of his undone Creatures, and to incline to save us; which Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore his Goodness designed, his Wisdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and his Active Power was prest to effect in the most excellent and effectual manner.</p>
                  <p>In God I have shewed we must conceive, while we see him in the Glass of his Works, and especially in that of our own <hi>Souls, Will, Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> the Perfection of which Three is <hi>Goodness, Wisdom,</hi> and an <hi>Active Spirit</hi> in doing Good, and that in infinite Wisdom; Man having cut himself off from the Influences of these <hi>Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> thus subsisting in the pure Deity. It pleased God to produce <hi>Manhood</hi> by the miraculous power of his Spirit, yet of the substance of our Flesh (a <hi>Manhood</hi> pure and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate) wherein he would subsist and tabernacle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, and by which he would operate unto their Deliverance and Salvation (for we must believe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Union was made in the second Person of the Trinity, yet 'tis the nature of God (which is indivisibly one in the Three Persons) that our Humanity in Christ doth (and that in the most intimate manner) partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; for as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> observes; the Persons of Deity are not Three Substances to whom one General Nature is common (as it is with the Persons of Men) but Three which subsist by one Substance, which it self is peculiar to God alone; only their several ways of having the same substance make their personal distinction: so that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37329:66"/> it is the whole Nature of Deity, as subsisting in the only Person of the Word that was made Flesh; <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> being only in the Person of the Son, but the <hi>Ʋnion</hi> with that Nature which he hath intire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisibe with the Person of the Father and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>The reason of which Mystery is this, Christ was God, that we might Worship the same as our Saviour whom we honour as our Creator, and he was the Second in the Blessed Trinity, 1. Because the Son of God was the most proper person to be Head of a new Generation of Gods Children; and 2ly To be sent by the Father, and to send the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and 3ly. Thereby we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that, in saving us, God exerts (not an absolute unconditional Will or a Physical Power of Necessitation, as in our Creation, but) an Almighty and gracious <hi>Wisdom</hi> for Moral Swation, such, that it is able to save to the uttermost those that are not so in Love with Death and Damnation, as wilfully to refuse its Methods of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for no Name can be more alluring than that of God the Father (to whom we are united to return) none more obliging than that of the Son of God, (by whom our Acceptance is assured) none so incouraging as that of the Holy Ghost (the Power of infinite Goodness and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by whom we are inclined and directed herein, and assisted against all subtilty and malice that may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us) therefore God as subsisting in these Three, and so operating as these Names do import, in and by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ, is most powerful in producing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, and Obedience to Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eternal Will,</hi> Gods Purpose to be as good and gracious to sinful man as would consist with his Holiness and Honour, and not prejudice his Wise and Righteous Government; I say, this was the Spring and Fountain of this Mysterious design: 'Twas this Will that first gave it being, and 'tis this which still gives efficacy to all the parts of it, as the following Texts witness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. v. 4, 5, 9, 11, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. and 9.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. and many more.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:37329:67"/>
                  <p>Will and Purpose do naturally and rightfully begin all Operations in free and perfected minds; therefore this must be supposed first in that <hi>Eternal Mind, which is GOD, That which is perfect Goodness, and can will nothing, but that which is Good:</hi> He is therefore said to work all things according to the counsel of his <hi>Will, Eph.</hi> 1.11. not as if God did things only because he would do them (as wilful men do) for his will hath always Counsel within it self, and a Productive of Wisdom (as I shewed before;) but because such is the infinite Rectitude of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the perfect Goodness of the Will of Deity, that the same is sufficient to give birth and beginning to all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and excellent Undertakings. The great Jehovah then first willed Christs Humanity as the Scene whereon, and Instrument whereby the Blessed Trinity would work what was meet for the Salvation of Man; so <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>A Body hast thou prepared me;</hi> and according to the good pleasure of this Will, we were predistinated; of Gods <hi>own Will begotten,</hi> by Vertue of the same, <hi>sanctified by the offering of the Body of Christ and by the mercy of the same saved, through the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</hi> as in the places fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted: so that as the Generation of the Son and Mission of the Holy Ghost, is from the Father, so the Efficacy of Christs Sufferings, and of the Spirits Operations, is from the <hi>Will and Purpose of Deity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Eternal Wisdom,</hi> as second in Order, is next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in this work: It cannot be imagined but that, when the Sovereign Will of Deity hath purposed so great a work, That whereby such glorious ends were to be prosecuted, and, in the due management thereof, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be attained; I say, but that then he should call forth his Almighty Wisdom to advise and direct all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of that great Action: Nor can it be thought but that <hi>this Eternal Wisdom</hi> should agree to the choice of our Humanity, as the Theatre of this Glorious Action, and most freely and willingly unite It to himself, so that It should be one person with him, and acted by him, to the uttermost advantage of the Divine Honour and Pleasure, and Mens Reconciliation and Salvation.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:37329:67"/>
                  <p>The Eternal Spirit (the Power both of the Goodness and Wisdom of Deity proceeding from the Father and the Son) is here last. (For in the Operations wherein Deity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to us, he is so, tho in those whereby we ascend to God, he is first in Humane Consideration) by him the Humanity of Christ was first miraculously formed of the substance of our Flesh in the Virgins Womb, and afterward inspired with a Courage and Magnanimity, a Compassion and Pitty, a Zeal and Activity, deserving to be called Divine in the highest sense.</p>
                  <p>Now the Wisdom of Deity according unto the Will and Purpose of Divine Grace and Goodness, by power of the Eternal Spirit, taking our Humanity thus qualified into an incomprehensible Unity with himself, must be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly able for the Work whereby our Salvation might be effected, even to the utermost; and the Eternal Spirit having th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s fitted the Humanity of Christ as a Mighty Instrument of Reconciling God to us, and us to God, must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed infinitly efficatious, while he dwells in Christ in unmeasurable fulness, and is from him derived in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant measures to all that unite themselves to him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the incomprehensible Deity exerts its infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for the Recovery and Salvation of us miserable Sinners, and these exceeding abounding Riches, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Grace and Goodness, of Wisdom and Knowledge, of Power and Activity, being in God, are poured on upon us, to teach us to be abundant and plentiful in doing good Works for the Honour of God, and Relief and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Men; and without this, we are incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving benefit by these Richest Communications of Deity; for <hi>He shall have Judgment without Mercy</hi> (even in mid'st of this Rich Grace) <hi>that hath shewed no mercy;</hi> but those that by the Reception and Contemplation of Gods Grace, are made good and gracious, so that they will the good of all Men, and both <hi>contrive</hi> and <hi>act</hi> for effecting the same, must be most dear to God. And the Blessed Trinity, whose Image they bear in their Souls and express in their Lives, will certainly be-friend them with a joyful reception into the Everlasting Habitations.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:37329:68"/>
                  <p>For the Divine Nature is infinitely inamour'd of it self and apt to unite in Love unto, and have co-habitation with all that are like to it self; (whereas the Diabolical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never be pleased with it self or its like, or dwell delightfully with it self or them.) But on the contrary. Light and Darkness may as soon agree, as God and the Covetous dwell together in these Heavenly Habitations: Therefore we read, that, Tho the gates of that glorious place are continually open, and all that do Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, enter in through the same, yet Dogs are still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; these Dogs can be no other but men of dogged and churlish Dispositions; these cannot enter, because of the contrariety of their Affections to those of the blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that place, of their utter unfitness for the work there to be done, and of their incapableness of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made happy by any thing, even in Heaven it self; nor if they would enter, could they ever be admitted by this Blessed Trinity, to which their nature is so contrary, and whom by their Practices have so highly offended, and when they never reconciled them by <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Good Works</hi> (the Fruits meet for the same) and not having made them their Friends, they cannot expect to find them so, when they shall be forsaken of all Creature Comforts, and driven out of these Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Habitations, and come to seek Admittance into the Everlasting Habitations of Bliss and Glory, as their last Refuge.</p>
                  <p>The next of those Friends which by well using our Riches we should make, that when we fail, we may be surely and joyfully received into the Everlasting Habitations, are the <hi>Blessed Angels.</hi> Among all the Creatures which God hath made, these are the first and chiefest Recipients of Blessedness from him, and the very Natives of those Everlasting Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bliss and Glory; these always had their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God the Father, and never at any time transgressed his Commandments; and therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37329:68"/> God may be inclined to shew us mercy, he will never receive us into those Habitations, either to the just Offence of these his Eldest and most Dutiful Sons, or any way to their prejudice: Therefore tho we may hope, if we repent and live again to God after we have been dead in sin, if we are found in Gods ways, after we have been lost in following foolish Devices and sensual Desires in our own, I say, that then these Holy Angels, admonished of by their and our Father; (as <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.) will also joyfully receive us, and Feast with us on the Entertainments of our Fathers House; yet while they look on us, as in the state of Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they cannot but be offended, if God should kindly receive us, and joyfully entertain us into his House and Family; and let not covetous Men think that this Prodigality which is so offensive to these Holy Angels, concerns not them; for they are as guilty of <hi>spending their Fathers Living on Harlots,</hi> as any that spend their Estates in Riot and Excess. Covetousness, of all other Lusts, is called Idolatry, and Idolatry is very often called in Scripture, Spiritual Whoredom; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to use our Gifts and Powers to gratifie this Lust of Covetousness, must be to spend our Fathers Living with Harlots.</p>
                  <p>Besides, 'twould be to the prejudice as well as to the offence of these Holy Angels, to have such base, dogged natur'd persons come to live among them, and therefore they must be supposed extreamly averse from receiving such to be Co-Inhabitants with them, in these Everlasting Habitations; we call them Good Angels, and they are called in Scripture Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, suppose them <hi>choicely Good</hi> and it takes in both; now as such, they must be thought to detest this base Humour of Covetousness, even from the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37329:69"/> of their own Nature; but besides, when we consider their Office, to be <hi>Ministring Spirits for the good of those that shall be Heirs of Salvation, to guide and keep us in all our way, to warn us of dangers,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem our Souls from evil, to pitch their Tents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us for our Defence, to fight for us against the Devil and his Angles, to give secret Influences to things to heal and cure our Diseases (as to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Bethesda</hi>) that they are ready to Minister to the supply of our extream Necessities (when our Faith and Patience hath been sufficiently tried) as they did to those of our Lord in the Wilderness; that they wait at our Altars, not only to pry into those Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mysteries, but out of delight to behold our Devotions, to excite us thereunto, and to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us in our Hallelujahs and Words of Glory; that they exult to behold our diligent Labours in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Christ, and our couragious sufferings, even to death, for Testimony of his Truth, and readily comfort and help us therein; and finally that they attend at our Death-beds, to carry our Souls, as soon as they leave our Bodies, with joy and triumph unto their Rest in Abrahams Bosome: I say when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all this and more, that the Scripture speaks of their Good Works towards men, can we think it possible that being of such a nature, and imploying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in such Offices, that they should ever be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive the covetous Misers, or any evil na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd and ungood Men into their Company and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, at least, until they arise from their Death in Sin, and be found in the way of Goodness, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Omnificence to all good Works; and then, as there will be joy in Heaven at their Repentance, so at their Death they may hope to be most safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37329:69"/> and joyfully received by them into the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habitation of Bliss.</p>
                  <p>The next of those Friends which we are to make, by well using our Riches for the end aforesaid, are the Saints. We read <hi>Luke</hi> 12. That 'tis the Fathers good pleasure to give the Kingdom to these who are Christs little Flock; the gift of the Kingdom is the Sanction of Christs Evangelical Law, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.6, and is the first and last reward of the Vertues there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed as the way to Blessedness; part of which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom consists in their Dominion over the Nations, as appears <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.26. which Christ gives to them even as he had received of his Father: This is no other but the power of receiving into, or shutting out of the Church, called the Keys of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; what the Church binds on Earth is bound in Heaven; this is indeed Administred Officially by such as Christ hath given to his Church for that purpose, but vertually is in the whole Church: from which I inter thus much (which I believe will be agreed to in midst of all Disputes) that those against whom good Men, true Saints, have just cause of offence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, shall never be received by Almighty God to the Glories of his Kingdom, of his Kingdom in this World or the next; not till they have reconciled them, and made them their Friends as far as they are able; now, that good Men are thus offended at the nigardly and covetous, appeareth not only by the general contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between good and bad Men, (the Wicked of all sorts being an abomination to the Just) but there is a peculiar contrariety in this matter observed in <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.7, &amp; 8. <hi>The instruments of the churl are evil, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth wicked devices to destroy the poor; But the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> (i. e. the Good Man) <hi>deviseth liberal things, and by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37329:70"/> liberal things shall he stand.</hi> So that these can never be friends, whose thoughts and actions are so contrary; therefore such Churls must change Nature and become liberal in good Works, if ever they will hope to have these their Friends to assist their joyful and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Reception into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But among all the Sanctified fore-spoken of, the Friendship of none ought to be so much sought by Rich Men as that of the Poor; because first, the poor Saints seem to have some peculiar right in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven on account of their very poverty, their more eminent Participation of this part of Christs Humiliation (his Poverty) gives them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to higher Degrees of Glory, and therefore the first Christians that followed Christ in the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World (<hi>viz.</hi> its first birth to Christianity) and in conformity to their Lord, and at his command, became poor, that the World by their Poverty, might be enriched with the Treasures of Evangelical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Grace; these, I say, had the Promise of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Twelve Thrones to Judge the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel;</hi> and tho 'twas but little they forsook for Christ, yet because it was <hi>their all,</hi> that made it so acceptable: Now, tho hence it will not follow, that Men should make themselves poor as they did, because there is not the same reason, yet if God make men poor, for Reasons he knows, and they most willingly comply with his Will, and adore that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which in our Humanity, sanctified that Estate, gave Example of the behaviour meet for the same, and Preached his Gospel particularly to such, then it will follow from his rich and exceeding Grace to those former poor, that some singular Favour shall be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to these latter (even above that which the Rich
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37329:70"/> in this World shall have) in the Heavenly Kingdom: St. <hi>James</hi> Chap 2. infers from several things the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial respect such should have in the Church on Earth; but I might infer from more things the respect they shall have in the Kingdom of Heaven above those that were Rich here in this World. <hi>They that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived evil things here shall be comforted there; Davids</hi> Prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.9. as a kind of Prophesie, and I have observed often, even in this World, that men have been <hi>comforted according to the time that God hath afflicted them, and for the days wherein they have seen evil;</hi> but those that in all their afflictions carry it well and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they may be sure that it shall be so with them in the next; therefore our Saviour hath told us possitively <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.30. That, <hi>the last shall be first;</hi> I know very well that there is more to be said by way of Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and caution in this matter than my bounds admit, but 'tis enough to my purpose, that the poor that have been Saints in this World, and so, in both respects, have been in it as Christ was, have in all likelihood a greater concern in the glorious and triumphant Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Rich into the everlasting Habitations, than others (who are Saints also) and this very thing hath made some of the Rich give away all, and betake themselves to a state of poverty; but it seems to me much better, when, in conformity to their Lord, even in midst of all their Riches, great Men can descend to the Exercises of a profound Humility and Self-abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; think themselves Worms and no Men, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Almighty; when they can bear it to be made a scorn among Men, and the reproach of the people, in midst of greatest Honours, Treasures, yea Vertues, because the sense of Gods infinite Greatness and Riches make them small and poor things in their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37329:71"/> own Eys, so that they can say, What if men tread on a Worm, or scorn a shadow, and such am I: When they can preserve the most perfect temperance in midst of greatest plenty, prefer the mortification of the Flesh before the lawful satisfaction of it, and that for the attainment of a higher Vertue, and when they have no other Reason for it; when their Riches are but the Instruments of Vertue, and made to minister to their abounding in good Works, and otherwise they are as if they had none. Those indeed are the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent sort of poor, such as in the highest sense forsake all to follow Christ, and therefore may expect the greatest Right in the Kingdom of Heaven: And because there are some such (tho alas too too few) therefore our Saviour saith, but <hi>that</hi> many <hi>that are first shall be last,</hi> whereas of the other, he useth an indefinite Proposition, which is equivalent to an universal, and saith, <hi>But</hi> the last <hi>shall be first;</hi> but yet still a Man that can most humbly submit to the Providence of God, and preserve in himself Patience and Composedness of Mind, and Courage and Magnanimity invincible, when he is outwardly in a mean and poor Estate, is the most glorious Person (at least next to him fore-mentioned) in the whole World; and 'tis sure that both these are so obliged to each of other, that they will never strive for Mastery: Such good Rich Men value such kind of divine Poor Men, as Gods Poor, and have a very great respect and veneration for them, yea more than for the greatest and proudest of the Sons of Men if wicked; and they value them most of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have opportunity of expressing Love and Honour to Christ in their Charity unto them, for that they are most peculiarly his Brethren; and his Image they bear in their outward Conditions: Such Poor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37329:71"/> have a mighty love and honour for these their Benefactors, esteeming them as Gods among Men, Gods of a better sort than great Men; Gods in such a sense as the Angels are called Gods; <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.7. For their being Ministers of Favours and Benefits to Mens Souls and Bodies, they Pray for and Praise God for such every day on Earth, and for these (if Saints hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pray for any Body) they will certainly intercede in Heaven in their place and station; and when the Souls of the good Rich Men ascend to Heaven, and their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger Angles bring news before of their approach to that Glorious Place, Oh! the Joy of these (once poor, but now chief of Saints) how will they fly from place to place to call and quicken all Saints and Angels to give them a joyfull Welcome (reporting their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Vertues, and many good Works) and do all they are able to make their Reception thereunto joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and glorious: But for those Rich Men that have despised the Poor, and censured amiss of the meaning of Gods Providences in making them such, that have reproached them as Hypocrites, or secretly Wicked, only because poor and afflicted; those that have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or injured such, because they are not able to resist them; those that have passed by them without regarding their necessities and sufferings, and never been concerned to help and relieve them, tho in never so great distress; such, I say, as these must reconcile these poor Saints whom they have thus injured and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, or they shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>AN EXEMPLIFICATION OF Some Particular Wayes OF Doing GOOD WORKS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome things I would premise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Exemplification. As First, That I intend not to tempt any man from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whatever of Good the things of this World may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him: Let every man take his Portion, and rejoyce in his labour, in Gods Name, for it is his Gift that we should do so; nay, so to do is the best Introduction to the practice of good Works: For the Wise Man hath well observed, that he that cannot afford to be good to himself, will never be good to any body else. The sneaking tricks of some rich men are as much <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n prejudice of their own benefit, as they are of <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>he Relief of the Poor, and other good Works.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37329:75"/> They cannot give either their Need or their Honour their due, any more than their Friends and the Indigent: They will not take what they need, or have a mind to, though they have to purchase it that which they shall never need, nor can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly use without some disturbance of their minds. They make themselves a Scorn to their Servants and Acquaintance by scraping without sence or reason, none knows why, or yet for whom: <hi>[Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Scraper brave man: Get to live, then live and spend it,]</hi> saith the excellent <hi>Herbert.</hi> If men would but get a perfect command of their bodily Appetites, so that they should never dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against a well disposed well advised Will, nor to offer any Pleasure as a temptation to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, nor to move one Sense to act against the dictates of Reason, and the resolves of the Heaven-born Mind, nor solicit the Fantasie to betray the Soul to the Devil; I say, if men would do this, they might let loose to as great freedom in using the outward Blessings God hath bestowed on them, as any can reasonably desire for themselves, or others justly expect men of their Estates should do. And this would give greater repute and power to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, than either the crabbed Austerity of Monks, or the cramm'd Coffers of Misers can do. But enough of this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That no man should be so intent on doing good Works, not in any way whatsoever, as that he should neglect a due provision for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and those of his Family, and such as have just cause to expect his help and succour in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of this life. Charity is to be added to Brotherly kindness, but not to go before it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37329:75"/> 1.5. <hi>He that provides not for those of his own house and Family, is worse than an Infidel.</hi> And yet that some, on pretence of giving to Pious and Charitable works, do neglect their Duty herein, is evident both by Scripture and Experience. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.11. we read of some that said to their Parents, That <hi>those things whereby they might be profited by them, were Corban, (i. e.)</hi> devoted to sacred uses, and so they did not honour their Parents by such help and maintenance as was suitable to their Estates. It is said that this Evil prevails much in those of the Popish Communion; and some also I have known among our selves, to exceed in such acts of Piety and of Charity to others, so as to disable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to do the good they ought to their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. But I have observed, 1<seg rend="sup">st.</seg> Extreams in this kind are very rare: And 2<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>. That where they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, they have less ill consequences than those on the other hand. And, 3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>. That it is in Relations ascending that this befalls oftener than in those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending, <hi>viz.</hi> in Childrens providing for Parents ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in Parents for their Children, yet I have seen it in the latter also: But then I have observed, 4<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, That God, notwithstanding the defect of Parents in this matter, provides strangely for their Children. Of the last of these Observations I have an Instance near me, <hi>(viz.)</hi> A Neighbour whose Father was so addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Charity, that notwithstanding he had a good Living, (for he was a Minister) and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and was of a good descent, he laid up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little for his Children, (which were many;) which one would have thought natural love and respect to the honour of his Family, should have caused him to provide better for: But yet there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37329:76"/> was not one of all his Children when they were grown unto mans Estate, but had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, either by their own Industry, good Matches, or the bounty of their Relations, to arrive at a Port suitable to their Birth and Family.</p>
                  <p>The reason of Gods Providence in this, seems to be, because such a charitable disposition is so rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and it is in it self an excellent perfection, though, through the infirmity of humane nature, it cannot beget such an excellent wisdom as it should, whereby to order the Exhibitions of it self in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts, as I observed before. Therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, it pleases God to give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to this goodness, which hath so much of his Image, by his gracious providence in favour of such Families.</p>
                  <p>But among the chief of those which we are thus to provide for, <hi>viz.</hi> our Children, some may prove such that it were a thousand times better leave them poor than Rich. For if once they have given the Throne to Sense and Fancy, and suffered their Mind and Will to be yoaked for their service, they are then no way so much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in hastening their own ruine, and bearing down all that God or Man can set against them to prevent them in it, as by being left very rich. This is too evident to need demonstration, and I have no skill or leisure to retoricate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall only say, that had I such a Son, I should exult in any opportunity of lessening his Forunes, (as they call them) and of justly leaving or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him poor: And if others think I am not a Fool in this, I have cut off one great avenue from hindring good Works.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37329:76"/>
                  <p>Again, Though Provision for Families is to be premised, yet what that Provision is, must be well considered. 'Tis not whatever we are pleased to call providing for our Families, which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse from such Works of Charity and Pious Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as I am speaking of: For it is not the humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an ambitious fancy, and desire of raising our Families to the heights of Gentility or Nobility, that is a making provision for them; but the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up such a stock as may minister to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry in getting a comfortable Livelihood, or to make them live according to the state of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily they are of. But when Citizens affect to make their Sons Gentlemen, or Gentlemen to make their Sons Lords, and for the gratification of such affection neglect to do such things for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and good of Mankind, as may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be expected from Men of their Estates; this is a very great fault, and a thing that hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evil consequences both in respect of themselves and Families.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It hinders themselves from taking their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what God hath given them in this Life; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> taking comfort and delight in the free use of the same; from making them serve to the supply of their necessities, giving due satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the appetites of Nature, and such like things in this World; but chiefly from making them minister to Gods honour and their own, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the laying up a sure foundation of their Eternal happiness in the World to come, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Works therewithall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that it oftener betrays the Happiness and advancement of their Families, than effects it. For
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37329:77"/> it may be, while they are in the midst of their design, death comes, and snatches them away, and they leave their Families between Peasantry and Gentility; and their Children unfit for either state: So that it often comes to pass, that all their Labours effect nothing else, but to raise the minds of their Children above the Estate they were born to, and to render them utterly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the duty of such a state, and negligent in making preparation for the same; and so the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state left being insufficient to Gentillize them, they spend it in an uncertain uncomfortable state, that hath no name, a state which is far less ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than that of ordinary Tradesmen; and after all, do very often leave the Family, design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Gentility, consign'd to everlasting Beggery. Or if their Parents live to get an Estate suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for that end, yet they often miss in making their Sons Gentlemen, or Daughters Ladies: for it is a mighty difficult thing for a Citizen to make his Son a Gentleman, and not have him spoiled in the making; spoiled, while he is in prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Estate he intends for that purpose. For a great Trade (as such must have) obliges men to continual attendance, and begets manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies of business; and this will wholly take them off from doing a Parents part in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Children: Or if they could do any thing towards their Education in general, yet that Education which relates to the making them Compleat Gentlemen, they cannot understand; or at least, no more than he that makes Shooes how to order the Trappings of my Lord Maior's Horse: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> It belongs not to their Trade. And when
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37329:77"/> men have a great deal of other business, and that of Education, which should fit their Sons for Gentlemen, is out of their Sphear; it cannot be, but that the things to be done in this affair, must be left to others: And then (if we consider the fondness of Mothers, the Flattery of Servants, the insufficiency or carelesness of Masters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) we may judge how well the thing is like to be done.</p>
                  <p>And besides, there is great fear the <hi>Man</hi> may be spoiled while the <hi>Gentleman</hi> is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: For while there are so many Hectors that live by debauching young Gentlemen, these, that are but learning to be such, will soon become their prey; for they have not that defence as Gentlemens Sons usually are provided of; <hi>viz.</hi> a Fore-warning by their experienced Parents, and a sense of the Honour of their Family, (which is debased by their keeping such Company) and the Conversation of other sober young Gentlemen of their own rank. But such as these are sent raw and unwary into places where these Varlets abound, having no sense of Honour to prevent their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting with them, and so, being little regarded by those that are born Gentlemen, fall of course on the temptation of such Company, with which at first they think themselves honoured, seeing them brave and genteel in Garb and Carriage; and so being used to their Company, they are easily drawn into the fellowship of their Vices; and so intwined with their indearment, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of holding any thing that comes into their possession, but suffer it all to be presently drawn from them, by these Suckers that stick to their Roots, and run up by their sides.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37329:78"/>
                  <p>But if they be not of so Sanguine a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to be inclined to Mirth and frolicksome Company, and so prove more sober; yet they may happen to be so blockish and dull, that it shall be very hard to teach them the qualities that belong to a Gentleman. <hi>(Every Block will not make a Mercury:)</hi> and if so, by the attempt of making them that they will never be, they are made useless for that which otherwise they had been fit for.</p>
                  <p>I have said this little of much that the Subject will bear, to prevent such designing among our Citizens as greatly hinders good Works, and yet effects no good to their Children and Families.</p>
                  <p>Whereas some pretend they have poor Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abroad in the World, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give so freely to other good Works, I must further observe, that I have never known any man that was very backward to promote what was for general good, to be extraordinary kind to his particular Relations. I have given and must give Brotherly-kindness, that is Liberality, to our Kindred in their necessities; then Preheminence to cemmon Charity; and shall alwayes commend those that begin their Charity at home, as the wisest and best men, so it do not end there: For <hi>while we drink waters out of our own Cistern, and running Waters out of our own Well; yet our Fountains must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed abroad, and Rivers of Waters in the streets,</hi> Prov. 5.15, 16. Relations are part of our selves, and therefore must first be provided for; but that being competently done, we must extend our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality further. When the <hi>Children are first filled, even the Dogs may have somewhat</hi> by our Saviours Rule,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37329:78"/>
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.25. And from his practice mentioned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the same place, I must observe this one thing, that in case of extream necessity this providing for our Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for our not doing acts of Charity and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence to others, and that presently. When a Person or Family is like to perish, when it is a time of extream want with multitudes of People (as of late,) when the saving a City or Kingdom is the consideration; we must not think 'tis the pretence of providing for Families, or poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, will excuse us from giving Alms, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Works. Therefore let none that have a competent Estate, on that account, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more excused than they are from doing good Works. Against which I shall offer this yet further: 1. If a man breed his Son a Tradesman, and leave him a <hi>competency</hi> to drive his Trade, so that he may drive it very well if he be diligent; 'tis full as good as if he leave him 100 or 200 Pounds more than is so needful. He that cannot drive his Trade with five hundred Pounds, will not drive it with six: And he that breeds his Son a Citizen, and leaves him 500 Pounds to trade with; his Son may live as well (if he be industrious) as a Gentleman of 250 Pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and may lay up more for his Children, (and that 250 pounds a year will cost 5000 Pounds;) So that there is no reason a man should decline the doing good Works that he may make his Sons Gentlemen. The same may be said for Daughters, who may marry Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with whom they may live as well as with a Gentleman of two or three hundred Pounds a year, having a Portion but of five or six hundred Pounds;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37329:79"/> whereas to such a Gentleman they must customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bring two thousand. Besides that when they are left great Portions, they are a mark to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Youths, who make it their study to steal the hearts of such Virgins, only that they may have their Portions to spend in Luxury and Excess; (as I observed before.) So that I hope those Citizens that have arrived at so good an Estate as to leave their Children <hi>such a competency</hi> as may suffice to enable them to live in the same rank with themselves, (if it be not their own fault) will think it reasonable then to addict themselves to some eminent acts of Charity and Beneficence. For, let them but consider this thing; There is so great a difference between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for Children, that they may live handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Citizens, and that which enables them to live handsomely as Gentlemen; that many that have made a sufficient provision in the first case, can scarce ever hope to live long enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide what is sufficient in the second. And I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed, that Children left in a state be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Citizens and Gentlemen, are more apt to ruine themselves, or be ruined by others, than any that are left with an Estate suitable to the one or the other: So that it seems to me great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for a Person that is growing towards old Age, when he hath laid up sufficient to enable him to give a competent stock to his Sons, and fit Portions to his Daughters, that they may live well in the degree of ordinary Citizens; then to resolve that he will not only give some occasional relief to the Poor in their single Capacity; but do some such eminent good Works as I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37329:79"/> mention. And if the middle sort of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens would but do thus, this would provoke the more wealthy, as not liking to be out-done by their Inferiours: And to assist this provocation, I will add a word to these also on the same Subject. Such Citizens as these I will suppose to be in such a capacity to Gentilizing their Families as the former sort are never like to attain, being it may be worth ten or twenty thousand Pounds; yet so much as would suffice for them to contribute to such good Works could not hinder their most effectual accomplishment of that design. For suppose now that a man were able to leave his Son three hundred pounds a year, or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to purchase it, it would add very little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the support of his Gentility, though he should make it three hundred and fifty Pounds a year; whereas one thousand Pounds spent in such works would render him a brave man, and also lay a Foundation for the Honour of his Family, and secure Gods blessing on his Children, which is beyond all the Estate he can leave them.</p>
                  <p>And this also will provoke the Gentry to do their part in these Generous Actions; for they are apt to envy Citizens that outdo them in bravery of Cloaths or Entertainments, and the like; and certainly they will not be willing they should out-do them in such honourable works as these: And indeed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be more necessary for Gentlemen to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ancient Grandeur of their Family, and encrease it, than for a Citizen to raise his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a higher state; because such Gentlemen are born to such services of their Countrey as require an Estate; and the fall of such Families proves a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37329:80"/> publick defect: I say, although this be so, yet this is no excuse from doing what is expected from them in this kind; for 'tis not the doing such good Works that ever ruined a Gentelmans Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Debauchery and Gaming, and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies; and these a Gentleman may without dishonour forbear: And whereas if he do so, in this wicked Age, his extravagant Neighbours may impute it unto Covetousness, and baseness of mind; by being abundant and exemplary in these good Works, he will stop their mouths, and make such suggestions signifie nothing with wise men. These things (which I hope will not be thought needless) being thus premised, I shall offer some wayes of imploying our selves and our Estates in the good Works I provoke to; but as briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>The first shall be in such things as tend most immediately to the honour of God, and good of mens Souls.</p>
                  <p>Of this kind I shall propose, First, The build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches suitable to the number of those that are obliged by our Religion to attend Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship; in which there is a great defect in the out-parts of this City; where there is but one Church for twenty, thirty, or forty, and some say, sixty thousand persons, all such as are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving the Communion: Now none can think a tenth part of these can be contained in the Churches belonging to such Parishes; or at least, that so many can hear what is spoken there; therefore it must be thought an excellent work to promote and assist the building and endowing of more Churches for entertainment of sueh People.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37329:80"/> But this being a thing of vast charge, I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wish that some Parliament would take it into consideration, and so lay the foundation for such a work, and give such aid in the Bulk and main Body thereof, that these Pious Donations of well-disposed men may be able to effect it, and that neither the insufficiency of all that which can that way be hoped for, may discourage any Benefactors from employing their Estates therein; nor the no necessity of Private help, because that of the Publick will do it in time, may disoblige any from doing their part, as they are single Persons, as well as Members of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of this Nature also is the augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Maintenance of Ministers in some Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Countrey, that afford not above five or ten Pounds a year to a Minister; by which means they have either no Minister at all, but live like Salvages, without any publick Offices of Divine Worship, or else such very bad ones, as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unfit on several accounts for that sacred Imployment. And if the Patronage of such Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations were committed to two or three pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and judicious men, with Authority and trust, that when either of them die, the Survivers should choose another of the same quality in his place: It seems to me the most likely way to secure such Parishes of the enjoyment of a good Minister.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Parishes where there is a plentiful main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the Minister, yet by reason of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness or carelesness of the Patrons, or their regard to Relation and Friendship more than to the Glory of God, and good of mens Souls, and for other causes, it doth often happen that very
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37329:81"/> unworthy persons have the Cure of mens Souls: Now when it is so, it seems to me a great act of Charity to provide that a fit and worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may be taken in to the assistance of the Parson, as a Lecturer or Curate; to which purpose it will be worthy the rich Men of such Parishes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute freely thereunto.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that the Bishop of the Diocess hath Power to suspend such unfit Ministers, and put better in their places; I answer, that there be some cases wherein the power given to the Bishop by the Law, seems to me defective as to this thing; and in those cases wherein he hath power, it is only on such proof of matter of Fact as is not easie to be made against such Ministers, who are often very subtle in their viciousness; especially if they make an interest in the worser part of the Parish (which is usually the greatest) to oppose such Prosecution: And it may often happen, that it is better to bear with an ill Minister, than to divide the Parish about his suspension. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that are good men, in such case were best to contribute freely, as beforesaid; which no Minister of a Parish will be against, because it is for his ease; nor the rest of the People (if he be sound and peaceable as well as pious) can have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to find fault with it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It seems great Pity to me, that in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous places, such as Countrey Towns where there are no Cathedrals, and in the Parishes of this great City, the excellent order of our Church for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers Morning and Evening, is not more carefully observed. There are two Reasons of this defect: The one is, that Ministers are by the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37329:81"/>
                     <hi>Rubrick</hi> excused in some cases from reading: Now because it is uncertain when these Cases will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, there can be no constancy of performance; and if it be uncertain whether there will be Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or not, or at what time it will be, few will mind to come, though they have no business; and many that would order their business to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereat, if they knew that certain time, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; so that the good order of the Church in that case provided, is to little purpose, except there be such a maintenance settled, as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Minister to read them constantly at a certain hour, either himself, or to provide some other to do it for him: Therefore I think it a great act of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to give freely to the settlement of such a maintinance. 'Tis an act of <hi>Piety,</hi> because God is greatly honoured by the Solemnities of his publick Worship: And of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> because there is nothing tends more to the comfort and edification of good Christians, than this; especially of such as have much time and leisure; and aged people that are going out of this World: For such to have opportunity so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be exercised in the excellent Works of praising God, hearing his Word, and seeking his Grace to prepare them for Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is an unspeakable benefit and Comfort. And the greater the number of Christians are that may have opportunity to frequent such publick Worship of Almighty God, the greater is the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of such Donations: Therefore in this great and populous City, and in that part of it that hath the closest Habitations, and greatest concourse of people, it is an excellent work to provide for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37329:82"/> the constant reading of Morning and Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For as the Honour of a King is in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his People, so 'tis greatly to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God to have multitudes of Worshippers. And in places where there is great numbers of Men, we may hope there may be many devout and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Christians, that may delight to honour their Creator and Saviour, and to enjoy this the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints in most solemn exercises of Divine Worship; and we may hope also that their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may draw others to <hi>taste and see how good it is to draw nigh to God, to behold his Glory, to triumph in his Praises,</hi> to attend to the great Mysteries of his Grace reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ, and hear the Records of his wonderful Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so by such tryal they may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the deceitful and destructive pleasures of sin, to the true and most wholesome pleasures of Grace: I wish this were well considered on the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al account which I shall here venture to mention, in hope to provoke the aid of some good rich man in a design of this nature.</p>
                  <p>There hath been an endeavour by some that are lovers of the Publick Worship of God, to settle a Maintenance for the daily reading Morning Prayers at St. <hi>Mary Woolnoth Lombard-street, London,</hi> where it is now read, and hath been so for above three years past, at Eleven a Clock, that by the encouragement of such a Maintenance it may be made Everlasting, which else is like to cease. The reason of which endeavour is, because there are many Inhabitants hereabouts that cannot be so early as Six in the Morning at St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> where Morning Prayers are also read, who at Eleven a Clock have no Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Excuse to be absent: Hoping also that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37329:82"/> among the multitudes of People that frequent the Post-house, to which this Church is next door; or among the greater numbers, about that time, drawn this way by the Exchange, to which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so near, there may be found some, and that not a few that will gladly afford their presence at this Church, there to add to the Solemnity of God's Publique Worship. Now here is an excellent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for some Rich Citizen or Gentleman to do a very good Work to the honour of God and good of mens Souls, whereby to purchase to himself and Family everlasting honors at a cheap rate (for three hundred pounds wil be fully sufficient for this matter.) And I hope that some one such, (considering the blessing it will entail on his posterity, and the eternal reward he may expect from God for this <hi>kindness to His House,</hi> and respect to <hi>His Honour that dwells there</hi>) will embrace the motion gladly. And I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise for the Parish that it shall not be wanting in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for a perpetual memory of him and his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that shall do this, because they would be obliged to this not only by Gratitude for so great a benefit, but because the Honour done to such a person in so eminent a place as this Parish Church is, would be a great obligation to others both in City and Country to do good Works of like nature: And I am so far affected with these reasons that, if I could not obtain this of the Parish, I would, with their leave) do it my self, (that being within reach of my allowance for such good Works, tho the whole three hundred pounds be much above it.)</p>
                  <p>After we have provided for places of Publique Worship and Maintaining persons to perform the same, it is a very good Work to take care that such
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37329:83"/> places be kept as clean and beautiful as any in the World; nay that, in that respect, they exceed all places in the World besides; can it be thought that any places deserves such Reverence and Honour as doth God's Sanctuary; or that God doth not expect from us as well as from his people of old, that we Reverence his Sanctuary, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. That it will be a good account at last, <hi>Spent in beautifying and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my own House ten pounds a year.</hi> Item, <hi>Given to the beautifying of Gods House nothing;</hi> and what Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of any Credit, may not account so as to his own House, 'tis two thirds of their Servants work to keep their House neat and clean, and the two thirds of keeping but one Servant is not less than ten pounds a year; But many keep more, and some only for that purpose, and besides in other waies of whiting and beautifying, spend as much more as in Servants: and yet when we come to these to desire them to give to the beautifying the Church, scarce one peny to be gotten; Oh the shame!</p>
                  <p>I am not now to answer those that contemn our Churches, but to provoke those that pretend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, and it is but need: I find that it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty difficult to find any way by a Tax, whereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one might be obliged to contribute equally to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for this thing; and therefore it must be done by Free Gift or not at all; for this Reason, I must use some words to perswade a greater willingness.</p>
                  <p>Some think that God so requires the inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in our Hearts and Souls, that he regards not what the places be wherein we Worship him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and therefore we need not regard it neither. But what is said to prove it? Not a word of reason, only one Scripture some bring for it, but 'tis unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37329:83"/> wrested, and that is <hi>John</hi> 4.20. <hi>Neither in Jerusalem, nor in this Mountain,</hi> &amp;c. The plain meaning whereof is this, that Christ's humanity, and what he performed therein, being the Spiritual signification and the truth of the Ark, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Seat, and all the Types and Figures which either the Jews Temple, or that on <hi>Mount Gerizim</hi> could pretend to, and this Humanity being now exhibited to men as the Temple or Habitation of the Deity, the Mercy Seat, or Throne of Grace, whence are dispenced to men all the Gifts and Graces received from God. Therefore men are not any more to ascribe such use to the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or to that on <hi>Mount Gerizim,</hi> but are to worship God as dwelling in Christ, in whom alone he will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to us. But what is all this against that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to. The Temple was beautiful, because God was worshipped before the Ark, the Type of Christ's Humanity; ours need not be so, because there Christ himself is present as he hath promised, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. Is not this a good Reason? Besides, the <hi>Synagogues</hi> where there was only natural worship performed to God, are called his Houses, <hi>Psalm</hi> 83.12. And therefore our Churches must be also owned such where we offer up our Bodys, made holy and clean, that they may be acceptable to God through Christ, which is our true reasonable service, or our natural worship, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.. And this holy use of Churches gives them a moral Sanctity, as all things must have that are related to Holy Uses; and being thus Gods House and Holy, can any think they should not be kept more clean and beautiful than his own House, or any mans else. Again, Can we lift up our eyes to Heaven and see the glorious pavement of that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37329:84"/> Temple above, that where Angels worship, and not think God's making that for himself, teacheth us to make the place where we worship below as stately and beautiful as we can, both as an indication of God's greatness, and signification of the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we have for him. Again, if we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the Text we shall find that the reason aforesaid, common to us with the Jews, was the chief cause of the beauty and glory of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.5. and other places. Again, if men would but enter into themselves they would find a desire, when they become great in the world, that the place where they are addressed and attended, where they manifest the glory of their munificence and bounty be more stately and beautiful than any Rooms in their House besides; would any great man wish to have his Chamber of Presence or his Banquetting House, as homely as his Hall or Kitchin; he cannot be a wise man that would so; and shall we impute such a will to the Great and wise God. Nor is the beauty and stateliness of Churches unuseful to us our selves, for that, as the making them such, is a proper and plain signification of honour and respect to God and of our gratitude for his giving us fine Houses, so, there being such, is a help to our Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. I would ask any man if he do not find as it were another temper of mind when he is brought into a Princes Chamber of Presence that is Richly Furnished and most beautifully kept, than when he passeth through his Common-Hall? and so I cannot think but that where Churches being stately built, are kept so curiously clean and neat as they ought, it would beget a kind of reverence of the God there worshipped and put men into a more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37329:84"/> fit temper for His Service, than if the places were basely built and slovenly kept. This hath been the common sence of all mankind, and if we deny our Churches thus to be Sacred and separate from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use, and keep them no otherwise than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, we are worse than the very Heathens themselves; and I do not doubt but that they who give freely to the beautifying their Parish Churches, and keeping them alwaies as if they were new built, and have a great delight to see all things decent and comly therein are far more pleasing to God than those that hold a contrary Opinion and maintain a contrary practice. So much in brief of that which I would have said more of if my bounds would have allowed it.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I shall mention, is the setting up a Weekly Lecture for the Conversion of the Jews, (whereof there are great numbers in this City) and for Conviction of the Heretiques, Schismatiques and Non-conformists of all sorts (who indeed are not in a much better state while they are out of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Christian Catholique Church) and I doubt not but His Sacred Majesty, if Petition'd to that purpose, would oblige them all to be present at such Lectures, and that upon such Penalties or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures as would be able to effect the same. And I think this a very seasonable time to propose such a thing in behalf of the latter sort, because the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of our good Laws have now made them more pliable to convert on rational Conviction, and no good man desires them to Conform without it; 'tis a false Charge, that we drive men to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as men do Horses to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for to receive those Mystries, they all confess it is their Duty, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37329:85"/> that they are such si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For the Jews, I am not out of hope, that such as live here may be more perswasible than those in other Countrys, and so the glorious work of their national Conversion (if such a thing may be hoped) shall begin here. I am informed that such Lectures there are in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Jews required to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them on very great Penalties, tho there they are hardly brought to because of their offence at the Bestiality, Superstition and Idolatry of that People. And it grieves me that <hi>Rome</hi> should out-do <hi>London</hi> in this ot any other Charitable endeavour of mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and I am sure the success of such an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is like to be greater here than there.

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37329:85"/> with their sentiments. Nor hath any such incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ingratitude been here offered towards them, as they complain there hath been in <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Popish Countries. They have been here obliged by great benefits and loving converses, the Christians of this City have been kind to them above any in the World, and the Government more just and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent than in other places; and this I think may make their Conversion the more hopeful.</p>
                  <p>They cannot pretend to any scruple of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence against this, for they are not to have any force put upon them to own or worship Christ as their Messiah, till they are rationally convinced he is so; they are not here desired to be as in <hi>Spain</hi> they were, condemn'd to have all their Goods Confiscated, if by such a time they were not Baptized; and then if afterward they were found at a Synagogue, to be burned. But that which is desired, is only that they be obliged by a penalty to hear what we can say to prove it their duty so to own Christ, and that it is also their greatest interest, in that neither in this World or the next they can be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                  <p>Some there are, and those men of great Name, that writ of a glorious state of the Church in this World, which the Conversion of the Jews is to be a Prologue unto, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. And this their Conversion they think shall be effected by miraculous Powers and Gifts of the Spirit, and by visible appearances of the Son of God. For my part I cannot see any Argument so cogent as to fix my mind in the belief of these things, or of that of their setled state in their own Land, and restoration to the outward Glories of a temporal Monarchy;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37329:86"/> nor do I think it will help their Conversion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with that ambitious and sensual humour in them that makes them fond of such conceits of recovering their former Glory and oppulency, no more than I do that the belief of the Churches outward Glory in the last Age will make us ever the better Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but I rather think the contrary in both.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we are too apt to follow Christ rather for the Loaves and Fishes than from a Conviction of his divine Mission; but then, they that do so, will cry <hi>Hosanna</hi> one day, and <hi>Crucifie</hi> the next; and I cannot see what real strength will be added to the Arguments for <hi>Christianity</hi> from belief of such world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glories: The excellency of <hi>this Religion</hi> lies in this, that <hi>as we have born the image of the earthly Adam,</hi> that is, have been concerned for an earthly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; so <hi>we shall now bear the Image of the Lord from Heaven,</hi> who is the second <hi>Adam</hi> indeed, but not as he restores us to such earthly felicity, but as he quickens us with desires of that which is Spiritual &amp; heavenly, and teacheth us, as his <hi>own Seed,</hi> and that a Spiritual Seed and new Generation of <hi>God, To seek the things above, as being dead and buried with him to the World, and risen with him to a divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life.</hi> The beginning of this life we have here in the knowledge and belief of the misteries of our Religion and in receiving the Sacraments of it; and the full perfection of it we shall have in Heaven, where the Felicities (I think) are quite of another kind than those which are here proposed: or if any conceive, on account of the Resurrection of our Bodies, that the Joys of Heaven have any thing of <hi>kind</hi> with these, yet they must confess them infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater in <hi>degree;</hi> now then what strength can be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37329:86"/> added to Christianity by that belief, <hi>That before we come to Heaven such a Glorious State shall be in this World,</hi> since none that are wise would be willing to come from Heaven, or stay from thence to enjoy it. I have touched this here, lest any should object, as some do, the impossibility of the Conversion of the Jews without Miracles, and the proof of such a state, which I think cannot be made. There was enough in Christianity to Convert multitudes of them, when they ventured loss of Life and Estate and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the malice of their Country-men and of all the World by being Christians, and it hath lost none of its force since, and much of that is ceased which might deter them from embracing it.</p>
                  <p>The inlargement and glory of the visible Church, is, I confess, a thing desirable, because therein men are in a nearer capacity of Salvation; but we must take heed that we make not the carnal advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians the chief motives to perswade men to be or continue such, and we may be sure that, how large and glorious soever the Church be, true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity will still be Rare, and the False-hearted will hate the Sincere, and of the Kingdom and Patience of Christ we must joyntly partake, the Godly must suffer one way or other, and fall into divers tryals for the exercise and increase of their Graces, for that Prosperity is more apt to depress than to heighten the true Spirit of Christianity, And the Enemy of Christ and the Church hath done no small mischief both to Jews and Gentiles by sowing and cherishing the Opinions of the Churches worldly glory, some sprinklings of which mischiefs we have lately suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and more do yet threaten us from men of that Spirit, therefore let us beware; But this on theby.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37329:87"/> My design here proposed is to make the Jews, and that a multitude of them, such good Christians that they may be the Riches and Treasure of those that are such among us that were Gentiles, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them into our Communion in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and other Christian Worship may be with such Joy and Triumph as shall be at the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. the place much insisted on: and I am sure this is more desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than such outward Glory; but enough of this.</p>
                  <p>There are many other things tending to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and stability of Christian Religion, which I might here speak of, but it will make my Book too long, and doth not so nearly concern us as other matter, therefore I shall omit them, only there is come to my hand a Book entituled, <hi>The Indians Advocate,</hi> written by a Person long conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, zealously reproving the Cruelties of Masters to their <hi>Indian</hi> Servants, as to the matter of their Conversion to Christianity; which Book I do here heartily recommend to Consideration.</p>
                  <p>NExt to the Honour of God to whom we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in strongest bonds, and to the welfare of mens Souls, which are more valuable than all their temporal concerns; a good man will esteem the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and welfare of the Kingdom and Community which he is a member of, valuable before his private benefit, or that of any other single persons, and what is done for such publick good he reckons among the chiefest of good Works. 'Tis much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that the sence of this is so much lost among men; and that after so many potent Cities and mighty Monarchys have been utterly ruined by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37329:87"/> base <hi>Selfishness</hi> of their members, yet we should not think our selves concern'd to avoid this odious and destructive vice in our selves. 'Tis evident from the name whereby such Communities of men have been ever known, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Incorporations or Bodys Corporate that every member thereof should be concerned for the good of all their Fellows, and when one member suffers all the rest should suffer with it, and it is impossible but every man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the nature and end of such Societys must commend and approve a Sympathetique mind and ready assistance in every person that takes on him such Membership, or is any way, by birth or breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> obl ged so to be. Now there are two Cases offer themselves to my Consideration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thousands that are Members of the same King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Corporation with me, are exceeding great sufferers, while my self and innumerable more suffer nothing by the same, here I conceive my self and them bound to give what assistance we can to our Fellows, and my own pungent sence of their Calamities, makes me think it impossible but that others must feel something also if they be not dead or stupid. And I think too, that those who have any true sympathy or fellow-feeling of their losses and sufferings will be ready to do what they can for their relief. If the Thing were utterly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and the Case such as nothing considerable could therein be hoped, it might suffice to mourn with those that mourn, but when That may be done whereby we may hope to effect it, and we will not do our part, then meer pity is but a kind of Pagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and increase of sorrow.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:37329:88"/>
                  <p>These then are the two great Concerns that I shall venture to recommend, <hi>viz.</hi> the sad condition of the multitudes that suffer first by Post-poning the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Payments, Secondly, by the insalvanry of the Chamber of <hi>London;</hi> and I believe every man that stands related to City or Kingdom as that Body which he is a member of, is as much concerned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the relief and reparation of these as my self, and most of them much more; and not to desire it only but to do his part to effect it. I fear the very motion of this will be counted great presumption in such a person as I am. But since I do herein open my mouth for the Poor, and plead the Cause of the Fatherless and the Widow, I am content to bear such Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. And that I may the more successfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound these two great Things, I will here insert a Digression about <hi>Self-Love</hi> written on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as that which by God's blessing may beget in men such a Publick Spirit and Christian temper of mind as may render them pliable to all Charitable motions, even those of greatest charge or trouble that require much Self-denial, and particularly those two I am here to mention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy Self,</hi> is the second of those <hi>Cardinal</hi> Precepts on which all the mo tions of mans Mind and Life do wholly depend, and they move most sweetly and regularly while they do so. Now here <hi>Self-love</hi> is rather supposed than commanded; for, that being a part of our very nature, we can scarce be said to be our selves otherwise than as we love our selves, we say of those men that, having lost the sence of their own good, do tear and rave and play the mad men, <hi>That they are besides themselves;</hi> so that <hi>Self-love</hi> being natural cannot properly be the matter of a Law any more than it can be that men should hunger and thirst, which they must do as long as they have natural Life. But though the being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37329:88"/> of <hi>Self-love</hi> be there supposed, yet the Regularity of it is not, but rather the contrary, and therefore in that Precept as annext unto the former of <hi>loving the Lord our God with all our Hearts</hi> we have the most perfect boundary for the Regulation of this natural faculty which can possibly be imagined. He that commands me to have special regard to the preservation of my life health and strength, and to the making due provision for my Family, gives me the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st rules for restraining the excesses and exorbitancies of hunger and thirst and other bodily appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and for forbearing such gratifications of these as are against both those being of far higher concern than a little present pleasure. Even so it is here, God in commanding us to love him above all and others as our selves teacheth us the best Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Self-love</hi> that possible can be. God is the very life of our lives, the strength and joy of our hearts, the light of our Countenances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he that prefers any thing before God, how pleasant soever it may seem, his <hi>Self-love</hi> acts irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. Again, Our Neighbour is a part of our selves; every one of mankind is our own flesh, we were Created altogether in <hi>Adam,</hi> made of the same blood, abstracted from the same body originally, and partakers of the very same substance; now if we so love our single selves as to cast off all regard of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with whom we are so much one, our <hi>Self-love</hi> must be conceived irregular and disorderly.</p>
                  <p>And, if it be truly weighed, we shall find that he that loves himself above God, or against his Neigbours good, may be said to hate himself; For altho desire of our own felicity (which is natural <hi>Self-love</hi>) be so ingrafted in us that no man can be said naturally to hate himself, that is, to desire or love such things as he apprehends evil and hurtful to him as such, yet in a moral sence it is true, because he wilfully chuseth that, for present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which his reason tells him will expose him to the hatred or displeasure of God and man, and will leave a pain and sting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it in his own breast, that will be far more grievous than the pleasure was worth to himself while he injoyed it.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37329:89"/> Self-conceit, and to make them to swell with discontent against the divine Restraints of their sensual appetites and ambitious Fancies: And with the same subtletie he is still working in the hearts of us all, to make us first proudly or foolishly to cast off our dependance on God and take our own way to be happy, and then to set our selves against the common interest of mankind and to strive to make all the World to serve our private interest and fancy: This Poyson of the Serpent having thus infected our Hearts, then flies up into our Heads, intoxicating our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, makes us fotget our absolute dependance on God both for our Being and for our Felicity, And our necessary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to mankind, as partakers of the same common nature and interests with us, and so to run headlong, in this our deliriation, into all evil and mischief.</p>
                  <p>Now that this delusion of the Devil was not such at first as man might not have prevented by the exercise of his own Reason, nor any of his cheats since such as can delude his Posterity, if they would but consider, is plain, because, <hi>First,</hi> Reason can easily discover that man separated from divine supports and influences is nothing, nor can be nothing, for as without any thing he was made by God, So unto nothing would he return if separated wholly from him; therefore so to love our selves, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a Consideration abstracted from God, is to love nothing, and to love our selves against him, is the way to lose our selves and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worse than nothing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reason can tell us, that, tho God by his power should sustain us in Being, yet if His wisdom do not influence us with a power of intellection, we shall be but a beautiful kind of Beasts; for to be a man, is to act by choice and reason not only by sense or fancy, and therefore we cannot love our selves as men, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not as our selves, in a Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abstracted from God in that sence. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Reason can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so tell us that if both the former influences of Duty be supposed. Yet if we are not also influenced by the divine goodness, we shall be but a kind of incarnate Devils; for they (once most glorious Angels) have a more excellent being and higher degrees of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son than the strongest and wisest of us all, And yet these glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creatures, having cut themselves off by Pride from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the divine goodness, do now bear the hateful name of Devils; and while we love our selves in a consideration (in this sense) abstracted from our dependance on God, our Love is not a Heavenly but a Hellish Flame. But now, though by the use of Reason, we may see in the very nature of our Souls, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37329:89"/> of other things, the Dependance we have on God as our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor both for the being and natural powers of our Souls, and their moral goodness, Yet our dependance on God as our Redeemer for our restoration from the miserable state of the Fall, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of an eternal felicity, we can only know from the Grace of the Gospel; there we understand our selves to be by nature Children of Wrath, Captives of Hell, accursed by Gods Law, in bondage under the terrours of Death, without hope because without God, (<hi>i. e.</hi> God's favourable influence) in the World. Now this state was worse than Primitive nothingness, and therefore far from being lovely.</p>
                  <p>There also we understand the mysteries of God's eternal Counsel, for restoring us to his favour, by uniting himself to our natures, and so becoming head of a new Creation (or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate state of the World) calling us into this Union by Gospel Ministrations, promising and exhibiting the greatest Blessings to those that obey it, and threatning more severe punishments on the refusers, than ever befel those that either disobeyed the Law of Nature, or that of <hi>Moses.</hi> Now if men so love themselves and their sinful gratifications, as to refuse to Love this God with all their hearts and souls, and unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereby under his most sweet and blessed Government, if they chose (for the love of sinful pleasure) to provoke God's Jealousie by slighting His Love (His Love I say) when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to be lift up on a Cross, with extended Arms to offer to all the World His dearest embraces, Is this <hi>Self-love</hi> a regular thing? Can we expect any other but that God for this will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly withdraw His favour from us, and leave us to the drudgery of Sin and Satan, to vexation and misery in this World, and Eternal Torments in the next; nay, hath he not told us, that he will do so by most clear Revelation? Now for a man that lives (as we do) under these Gospel Ministrations, to love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any otherwaies than in subordination to loving God our Saviour with all our heart, is stark <hi>Bedlam</hi> madness, for that is to love himself as a Rebellious Sinner running headlong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to Dance in the Chains of Sin and shake them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of his Deliverer, to cast the Fire-brands of Hell in his Sa- own face, to open his breast to the arrows of God's Vengeance, and dare eternal Death; and all this in sport, and under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Loving himself. Lord Jesus! What a thing is a sinner forsaking thee, or forsaken of thee in this time of Love under the Gospel! What! a thing to be beloved? Certainly with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37329:90"/> no Love but of Commiseration, and scarce with that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

It was the highest favour of our Creation to be made Partakers of the Divine Image in the nature and faculties of our souls, but by the glorious Promises of the Gospel we are made Partakers of the Divine Nature, in the regular operations of these faculties in conformity to the Divine Perfections; by that we had the subjection of the Creatures, by this the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of all things for our Good; By that provision against mortality in the Tree of Life, by this we triumph over it through our union to the Lord of Life; (but I am transported beyond my bounds by the sweetness of the Subject) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he must be blockishly or wilfully blind (under this Light of the Gospel) that doth not see that there is nothing more lovely to men (besides God) than themselves being in due subordination to him, But while we set up our Interests against His, nothing more loathsom.</p>
                  <p>I will but touch the second and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Head.<note place="margin">No man can love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that loves not his Neighbour as himself.</note> The reason of man can easily discover that we cannot love our Neighbour aright, except we thus love our selves as standing in due subordination to God, and also that to love our selves as having any interest diverse or contrary to that of our Neighbour can be true or rational Love to our selves. For no man can consider himself as an object of Self-love any other ways than either as a part of the Community of Mankind or as a kind of God over all the rest, for in an abstracted capacity he can have no love (of complacency at least) to himself. Now though the Serpent had infused this poysonous conceit into our first Parents, that they,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37329:90"/> by following his Counsel, should be as Gods; yet both they and their Posterity have found him a Lyar (as he is) and their attempt to be not only vain and ridiculous, but infinitely mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous as to themselves as well as to others. For while we all keep our subordination to God and our Communion in Love, His Providence (like the Sun) comforts and cherishes all, and our mutual Aids make the labours and troubles to which we are all born easie. But when we set up our interest above our Neighbours, and seek our selves above the Common Good (which is a kind of Deifying our selves) this tends to bring our selves and them to confusion. For if all the World must truckle to us, and all things be as we would have them, except we were able to defend them against all that's hurtful, keep them in due order among themselves, and in obedience to us, and provide for them what they want, I say, except we could do this it must needs tend both to their confusion and ours: and if we arrogate to our selves their Services, we cannot think God will govern them, and provide for them as our Servants.</p>
                  <p>Now think with your selves, if God should give you leave to ascend his Throne (as <hi>Phoebus</hi> did <hi>Phaeton</hi> to mount the Chariot of the Sun) what work you would make of it. He would no doubt be forced (as 'tis Fabled of <hi>Jupiter</hi>) to send a Thunder-bolt and strike you into the Sea of Perdition, that he might save the World from Ruin. And yet this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of loving your selves against the interest of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Again, consider every one is as dear to himself as you to your selves. Now hence it will follow, that if you may love your selves against another, he also may love himself against you, and so all the World must be brought to confusion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Reason of it self may conclude, that to love our self as a part of the Community of mankind, and to love our Neighbour as our selves, because he is man as we are. To seek his Good as we wish he would do ours: and to esteem our felicity when we are doing him good to be as great as when Receiving it from him, I say, Reason of it self may conclude that this is the true and genuine <hi>Self-Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not able to express the conceit I have of the felicity of that man that thus Loves God above all, and his Neighbour as himself, especially now in this administration of the Kingdom of Grace; now God is exhibited with the brightest Glory and most ravishing beauties of Deity, and man is not only recovered unto nnocency by the Grace of the Gospel, but, together with Christ
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37329:91"/> Jesus, is raised up to a Glory unconceivable, being made to sit, together with him, in the high and heavenly places which are far beyond that of the earthly Paradice for Glory and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; now the Unity of Deity in the Trinity of Persons, shining and operating in Christ Jesus, hath united all mankind, that will be saved, into a divine Corporation under <hi>God in our flesh</hi> as head thereof, to live <hi>together</hi> shall I say, nay <hi>to live in God and each other,</hi> and in interchanges of Joy and love, mutual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and sweetest embraces in mind and spirit, and freest distributions, in respect of outward possessions, as every one needs. The fixed peace and satisfaction of mind, the pleasant and exhilerating reflections of memory, the decent and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actings of all his faculties, make him a kind of Heaven on Earth; he never enjoys greater showers of divine blessings and comforts than when he is pouring out himself in watering the dry and thirsty Souls of others as <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. but I must not give scope to my mind here lest I digress too far, only thus much may not, I think, be amiss before such an unexpected offer as I am now to make, and when much of Self-denial and a Christian Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity is requisite to prepare men for a kind and successful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it.. And now I return.</p>
                  <p>The first thing then I here recommend as a very good work of this kind, that whereby we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our selves truly members of the body we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, is this: That every English man, according to his capacity, should put to his helping hand to the inabling His Majesties Exchequer to giv<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>I know also that private persons, especially in that capacity, cannot do much in such a work, and therefore some may think the motion useless. But tho' they cannot begin it and lay the Foundation for it, yet they may be prepared to do their part against a good day, when they shall be called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by publick Authority: And those who are now in their single capacity but private men may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to serve in Parliament where they will be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Persons, and the major part of these so called are that Authority by whom this work must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and by whom we must be called to do our part; and I should be glad to be the fore-runner of such a happy Parliament, and to prepare their way before them: and if I might presume to hope that these Papers may come into the hands of any that shall be so called, and may have that influence I desire to dispose their minds to the thing that is here Justly and Charitably proposed (as I think) in the behalf of the many thousands that suffer in this Case. I say, might I hope this, it would chear my Spirits and make all the repraoches insident from scornful and sensorious men, for this which they will call a bold undertaking, easily tollerable by me. And why should not I hope this, since God hath formerly chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, the weak things of the world to confound the mighty, base things of the world, and things despised, yea things which are not to bring to note the things that are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. and naught knows what his methods may be now, I will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37329:92"/> therefore in the uprightness of my heart, in Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gods Aid and Blessing, set down my thoughts on this Subject, and offer them to publick view.</p>
                  <p>That Standard whereby all acts of Justice and Charity are to to be tried will direct us here how to take our measures; <hi>what we would have done we must do;</hi> now I do believe none of those who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be Givers or Lenders towards the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these Debts, but would be willing, if he were a Creditor, to have others assist towards the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Debt that he might be a receiver at least of some part thereof. That some should suffer the loss of thousands, and that on a Common and Publick account, and some lose not a Groat, yea be great Gainers by the bargain, seems very unequal. When God rained Manna from Heaven, mens ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings were very unequal, yet when they came to take the measure of it every one shared alike; what God did by miracle we should do by Wisdom and Charity, that so all may rejoyce and praise God together, and so it will be when, in imitation of the Almighty, equality is made by such prudent and free interchange of supplies, as the great Apostle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. I need but touch this Subject which hath been the burden of the whole Book, yet I must mention it, as that which is most needful to prepare mens minds to comply with this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to their several capacities. But that I mainly intend is to remove the prejudices which men have in their minds against this, or make shew of in words, to justifie or excuse their opposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:37329:92"/>1. 'Tis mightily insisted on by a Writer of the Bankers Case that the Contrivers of that design should be brought to condign punishment, for that the thing ought not to have been done, and that 'tis such an ill president that we cannot be secure of any thing we possess if it be allowed, but may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear that under pretence of necessity all mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties may be invaded.</p>
                  <p>I know that Discontent and Covetousness may make innocent things seem faulty, and such as are in no great fault intolerable, and some can multiply words on any Subject, and are very pregnant when their minds are agitated with the forementioned pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; but, when they have said all they can, they will be forced to grant, that there may be something of truth, and wisdom too, in the Old Proverb <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity hath no Law,</hi> and, <hi>That there are some equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cases, incident to the affairs of Princes as well as of other men, in which a dispensation with the Laws of strict Justice may be allowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if there were such necessity that might justly plead for a judgment according to Equity, &amp; not to be censured according to strict and Common-Law, this quarrelling with evil Counsellors, &amp; reflecting on his sacred Majesty is very blame worthy, and calls for Repentance. For my part I can never think that these their accusations and wordy assaults do not touch his Person and reproach his Government, or that a Prince that hath ever had a sense of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God hath laid on him to carry his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his Bosome as a Father carries his sucking Child, an Obligation as great as if he had both Conceived and Begotten them all, as <hi>Num.</hi> 11, 12. that hath Governed with so great Justice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness during all his Reign, and useth such a sagacity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37329:93"/> and precedence in Councel as is admirable to those that appear before him (as persons honest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent have told from their own experience.) I say that such a Prince should not have an infinite concern for his Subjects, when a thing was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Councel, which was apparently so grievous provoking and prejudicial to a multitude of them: That his Bowels should not Yerne towards those that should hereby be made miserable; the Widows and Orphans, that would be utterly defeated of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions made by wise and careful Husbands and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; the Decrepid and Old, of their preparations for a state of infirmity and age; the Virgins, that have been generously educated and provided of good Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that must now marry their Fathers Grooms or Coachmen or else remain solitary; a great many Gentlemen, that had been brave Souldiers and great Sufferers for His Royal Father, that would lose the little they had reserved, to support themselves and families, and to keep them from downright beggery; These, and many lamentable things more, could not but affect the compassionate soul of the best natured Prince in the world; And that this should not awaken all his studies and contrivances to prevent it and set His Great Wisdom and Sagacity as it were on the wrack it is incredible; especially when he considered that the Laws must be broken, (which, above all His Predecessors, he had been careful to keep inviolable, and never dispensed with but in pity of His Subjects; in relief either of the tenderness of their Consciences or of the utter ruine of their Lives and Estates) that the rights of many must be invaded, (whenas he had hitherto been able to say as the good <hi>Samuel,</hi> whose have I taken or whom have I defrauded) and that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37329:93"/> he must be knowing and active in all this, and could not acquit himself, as some would acquit him, by saying that he must see with other mens eyes and do with other mens hands; the concern was so great and near that it could never be thought to pass his own observation, and of so great wait, that the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own immediate consent and command was of necessity to support it, since if any others had appeared to take it on themselves they must have sunk under the odium and indignation of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and their partakers: this shews that His most Sacred Majesty was awakned to the most intent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the thing, and so to weigh all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, compare the mischiefs that threatned, if this were not done, with the consequent inconveniencies if it were, and being a Prince indowed with so great wisdom and sagacity, and assisted with so wise Councellors, so highly concerned also themselves, and finally when we consider the divine assistance that is intailed on Princes by the promise of God, and the very reason of the thing it self, I say consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all this we must conclude that the case was very extraordinary, and sufficient to plead a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Laws objected, and that it is better so to justifie the thing then to represent the King as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine wholly acted by the Spirits and Councels of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seeing with their Eyes and hearing with their Ears as if he had none of his own, and therefore I hope that Author and all the world will believe that I am actuated in this Discourse with the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses of mind which he pretends to, <hi>viz.</hi> such as loosned the Tongue of the dumb Son of <hi>Cressus,</hi> when, to repress the violence about to be done to his Father, he cryed <hi>It is the King,</hi> and there can be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37329:94"/> nothing more effectual with Loyal men and dutifull Subjects to create a good belief in this thing, than this consideration, that the King, being convinced by mighty reasons of the necessity of the thing in that unhappy juncture of affairs, did, very much against his inclination, and with great reluctancy of mind, consent that the thing should be done, verily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the next Parliament, being convinced of the necessity of the thing, and being full of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion which he found stirring in his own Breast, would readily grant such supply that the Exchequer payments might return to their former order: And if we had this belief in our minds we should rather use our wits and power in remeding, than in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the thing; for in this case I must believe and perswade others so too, that a <hi>Divine Sentence was in the Lips of the King, and his mouth transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not in Judgement,</hi> as Prov. 16.10.</p>
                  <p>But besides that this makes it highly probable there was an extream necessity for this offensive thing, the evidence of the thing it self is Great. I have not much concerned my self in matters of state, yet I can see enough to evince the necessity of the thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>preservation of this Nation</hi> is a matter of highest concern, a Nation reverenced by all the world for its strength at Sea, a strength that all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours acknowledge by striking of Sail to our Men of War: the preserving it I say, from being insulted over by an Enemy whose very nature is insolent, and whose practices, when ever ours have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their power, hath been most inhumane; whose abuses have been so great to Us and to other their Neighbour Nations, that, were it not that they have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37329:94"/> the same Religion with us, and are somewhat excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the borishness of their Education, &amp; that we may hope they may once come to be improved by their conjunction unto the English Monarchy (the hapning of which will make a day most happy to that People of any that ever saw the Morning Light) and made more Gentle and Neighbourly, I say were it not for these and such like things, they were scarce tolerable among men; a Nation that never were, or can be more happy than under our Conduct and Protection, that owe their present O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency and Greatness, and, I had almost said, their very Essence as a Nation to us under God; I say this seems to me a very great thing. It is well known among them (and may be to us if we would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it) how they then exulted in the poverty of the Exchequer, and represented the King in Books and Pictures as Poor and Beggerly in a most hateful and provoking manner, and concluded it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as then charged, that the Exchequer should be able to support so expensive a war, and that we must therefore become a prey to their insatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness; they entertained themselves with many pleasing conceits of the great advantages they should have by the ruine of our Fleet, and disabling us to retain our ancient Honour and Power at Sea; and thought the thing so sure, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themselves within the bounds of modesty in the anticipating the Joy thereof; their Words and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers so abounding with expressions of the pleasure they conceived, that it became fulsome to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unconcerned; now can any one think that here was not a great necessity for post-poning the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Exchequer, when to prevent the cause
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37329:95"/> of their insolency, and our own ruine, the order of its payments was changed: a necessity so great, that I have been informed the greatest and wisest of our Enemies thought it sufficient to justifie the action, and could not but approve it, even tho their great hopes were defeated by it; now methinks all this may suffice to evince the necessity of the thing: It may I say suffice <hi>to men</hi> that have reason that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all to do as they would be done by, <hi>to Christans</hi> that have a Religion that teacheth Love and Honour to our Prince, and that above all Religions beside <hi>to Subjects</hi> that have a Prince of such Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Government as exceeds all his Predecessors, suffice I say to perswade them that if any necessitie were ever known in this Nation that might occasion the Proverb aforesaid, and prove the wisdom of it, this must at least bear proportion with the greatest of them, and therefore be exempt from the force of Law taken in strict sense.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Would Subjects be as just to their Prince as they desire he should be to them, it could never happen. But that, when he allows them a Chancery for all the equitable cases occurring among themselves, yea such wherein the strict inforcement of Laws for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his Person and Propriety may intrench on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and doth besides take off their force often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by using his Prerogative in Acts and Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace and Mercy to Offenders as far as can consist with the innocency and peaceableness of his Government, I say that for all this we should allow the King no Chancery in our own Breast, but rave and rail against him as invading Propriety and not observing exact justice and the strictness o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:37329:95"/> freely made, and his Proclamations to keep them inviolable in this matter, I say both these shew how much the thing was against his Inclination and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, but neither the one nor the other are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that the thing might not be done in such a case of extreme necessity scarce possible any other way to be provided for. I know mens brains, that are empty of the knowledge of such great affairs, are apt to be full of Projects <hi>how the thing might</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have been done: But what if such Projects should have proved like these of the Eternal Motion, which seem very like to effect it, but by experience are found worth nothing, and the ruine of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had ensued?</p>
                  <p>But 3ly. though the necessity were proved never so great, and equity to plead the case never so well, some men well think the thing ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for that <hi>the jealousie of having this brought into a president,</hi> if it should be so far owned as to pay the Debts, is in their esteem a sufficient argument against all that can be said herein. And indeed jealousie of our Princes is a disease most incident to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Island, a disease of such nature, that scarce any of the affected will believe it to be a disease, or indure any thing necessary for the cure, nay a disease that is increased by the indeavour of a cure and works on those that prescribe any thing to work it out of our minds. Every one is jealous, of him that speaks against fears and jealousies, that he is of the Court party, a Traytor to his Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so long, all he says against it is vain to them, yet I have a great confidence that, where men are not irrecoverably affected herewith, it will not have this effect on me, for, so long as it doth not take away their senses, <hi>they</hi> must know, <hi>that know me,</hi> that 'tis
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37329:96"/> scarce possible such a thing should be true, or that any thing but their own and the Publick Good should move me to this Charitable undertaking, and because I believe certainly that nothing can be more contrary to fearing God and honouring the King than an easiness of being impressed with such fears and jealousies. God commands That Charity which thinketh not Evil, no not of any man, much less of Princes that are as gods among men; and can any pretend to fear him, that think all the evil of the King which is possible, yea that which a man who knows him would not think possible to be thought. The chief things wherein our honouring the King doth consist, that without which all the shews of it are but Pagentry, is a hearty esteem of him, as Gods Chief Minister and Favourite, a most joyful and thankful acknowledgement of the excellent indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether of Nature or Grace, that God hath bestowed upon him, a great unwillingness to see, or speak of his Nakedness, in either respect, and a care to cover it) when detected by others (with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our Reverence to his Paternal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now no man that believes this (as I wonder any one should not) but must conclude the jealousies I speak of are against the honour we owe the King, and 'tis a wonder to me how any man, that ever read the Scripture or learnt his Catechise, can make a shift to keep a quiet Conscience while he indulgeth himself in his Vice. I confess I have heard now, and then by chance, something that intimates some ways for it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by odd definitions and distinctions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Seat of <hi>Supream Power,</hi> which they say is the King; and false conceptions of the reverence we are to have of Him, which some Citizens have said
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37329:96"/> (when a major vote made them impudent) is no other than the dread we are to have of Lyons, and other mighty Beasts of prey; these things shew Wit and Impudence, but will never satisfie Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor shall any of them ever enjoy such peace of mind and inward delight in conceiving and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting these jealousies of our King, as we have in cherishing in our own Breasts, and propagating in the minds of others, a good belief of him.</p>
                  <p>But I confess I am more afraid of being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proud for attempting a thing of so great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than a Courtier or Traytor for speaking for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against these pernitious jealousies; but that being the fate of all that indeavor to effect things truly honourable and praise-worthy, to be so accounted, doth not much concern me; if I could have found it had been done before, and that the circumstances of things were the same now that made it ineffectual then, I had not touched this Subject, but I could not be informed of either. Therefore as to this jealousie of making an evil president by assistng the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, let me add something further.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the thing were not ill done the Argument is void, for we ought to have a jealousie of ill things only, lest they be brought into president. And if it be said that it was such as might be thought ill by succeeding ages, who knew not the circumstances that correct it, and those blamed hereafter who should own now it; I answer, that error might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be prevented by the preface of the Law for redress of the Sufferers wherein the necessity might be specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If it be said that such Prefaces are not regarded, but matter of Fact pleaded and brought into Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I can by no means grant it, especially in an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:37329:97"/> case that concerns mens Purses, for men are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very productive of Arguments against Taxes, and very quick witted in finding flaws in the arguments of those by whom the making them is inforced, and therefore the Preface of a Bill to that purpose well worded (as I believe it might be to the fatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the most jealous, and yet pass) could not miss of its end to prevent bringing this into a presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any ill purposes.</p>
                  <p>I have heard some urge the abuse of the Law made in <hi>France,</hi> for the Kings raising mony in case of necessity, but very impertinently, because there they gave the King power to raise the mony, and to judge of the necessity, neither of which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                  <p>And since the Judgement and Power in this case is in the people and that they are masters of their own Purses; we may think that the necessity must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent before they part with their mony, and I must take leave to say, that an extream caution in this case hath been more pernitious to this Nation, than any imposition that ever was laid on us by the Prince, and I believe no man, that is forty year old, will put me on the proof of it, for fear of being counted so very dull that the Teacher of Fools could not instruct him, or to have put on the same mufler, with those that could not, or would not, see this plain thing, <hi>viz. that mischiefs a hundred fold worse attend</hi> the repeated denials of Princes reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests for mony, than these that are consequent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their illegal impositions, in case of extream necessity, or to the mispending some part of that mony to uses which it was not designed to; I say that would not see this, until they and the whole
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37329:97"/> Nation felt it with a witness beyond all possibility of ignorance or denial.</p>
                  <p>But if men will yet insist on this jealousie, let me say this one thing more, That if, as wise men, they will think themselves bound to use so great caution for preventing impositions on the People, I must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so believe that as good Christians, they ought also when they have done their best, to put their trust in Christ Jesus so far, that they should not refuse to do a thing so Just, so Charitable, so Pleasing to God, so agreeable to <hi>His</hi> Example, who did not withhold his grace from those that needed it, for fear some might abuse it; I say should not refuse to do such a thing only for fear some ill use may be made of it by succeeding Princes; for Good Christians have such belief in Christ, <hi>as the Wisdom and Power of God,</hi> that they rest satisfied, that in such cases, he can and will find ways to prevent that and all other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that may otherwise follow the doing so good a work.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, as I know it is by a great many, that His Majesty is able to do it himself.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that it is most evident that of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bounty he hath done to his ability yea beyond it for satisfying this Debt, insomuch that the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer hath been found to retard sometimes the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath ordered; that he hath taken down the Expences of his Court more than any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, and abridged his own Grandure, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged the Servants and Officers of His Court by short allowances and lessning their Wages, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other things that shew how desirous he was to do the most could possibly be expected or reasonably desired for his part, and if he had not some most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37329:98"/> and ill natured Subjects, he had never heard of any such objections, but I hope he hath many, yea the most that are otherwise, and as God hath owned his Pious and Charitable indeavours by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pieces the Conspiracies of such men against him (the chief Head of whom was (as 'tis said and very probably) one of the chief Advisers of shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Exchequer) so I doubt not he will at last open the eyes of all that have any honesty among them, that they shall see their fault and become his friends. But some say it is policy, as things stand, to keep the Exchequer poor. To which I answer, That, the policy they dream of, in weakning His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Exchequer, hath so many intreagues in it, and supposeth so many things that may never come, and that I believe God will prevent if they will joyn with us in doing their duty to Him and our Prince, that it is not for me to meddle with it, and it were well if they would not neither; for I am fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the jealousies of that kind have brought more mischiefs on themselves and the Kingdom already (and were like to have confined us to tenfold worse hereafter) then ever they can suggest the doing this thing could ever have effected. But discontented minds will still make men grumble, (as I have heard some do) <hi>the Parliament were not consulted in the making that War,</hi> and therefore why should they concern themselves about maintaining it, especially now the thing is past, let the blame lie where it will they cannot be in fault. To which I shall be bold to reply, That never Prince used the Councel of his Parliaments more industriously, and to the fullest satisfaction of His Subjects and all men; but it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unreasonable not to allow any secrets of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37329:98"/> and render his Prerogative, in this case of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War and Peace, to be vain and useless. It is evident, that there wanted not such Just Pretensions for this War, as were allowable by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; That, on his Majesties part, it was manag'd with due Care and Vigor, which appeared in this, that when the Person that lay next his heart freely offered himself to be Chief in that Great Action, he was Commission'd by him so to be, tho his life thereby was put in Eminent Hazard: And if his Majesty, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unquestionable Power by Fundamental Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, did justly undertake and vigorously ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd that War, which was occasion of this Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; my-thinks this that is before objected should be no exception to good and loyal Minds against gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving help in the Case.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37329:99"/> that <hi>Love, Joy,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> will abound on all Hands, and also this Unity between the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People,</hi> will tempt the most Factious and Schismatical to try to lay aside their Ill Nature, and become Friends to <hi>CHURCH</hi> and <hi>STATE,</hi> and to One-another; And so all of us living in Peace, and in Exercise of Brotherly Kindness to Each-other, the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> who is <hi>Love and Goodness it self,</hi> will delight to dwell among us, and will multiply our Seed thus sown, and <hi>Increase the Fruits of Righteousness,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. So that none of those that are concerned to Give or Pay toward this <hi>Good Work,</hi> shall have ever the less, but rather much the more. The blessing of the <hi>poor Sufferers</hi> thus Relieved, will be upon us all, and we shall rest assured of like help in our Necessities, if such should Occur; and we shall certainly enjoy greater satisfaction in our own Minds, in the sense of having done our Duty to <hi>God,</hi> to our <hi>Prince,</hi> and to our <hi>Brethren,</hi> than can possibly accrue from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Fears and Jealousies, denying Reasonable Supplies when desired, disabling the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Power (which is of so great Necessity for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Honour of the Nation) to prevent <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government,</hi> when there is no great cause to fear it, and things of such Nature, sometimes highly Applauded by men of an Ill Spirit. Therefore my <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Almighty God</hi> shall be for the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That thus to do Good and to Communicate they forget not; because I believe that with such Sacrifices God would be well-pleased.</hi> And thereunto I hope not only the <hi>Sufferers,</hi> but all <hi>good Christians</hi> and <hi>loyal Subjects</hi> will say, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Thing of this Nature, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to recommend as a very <hi>Good Work,</hi> Is the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37329:99"/> of the <hi>Chamber of London</hi> to pay their Debts both to <hi>Orphans</hi> and others: There is need of no more to prove this a <hi>Good Work,</hi> then what was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Therefore that which I shall here intend, as far as this brief Discourse permits, is the effecting a Willingness in all Sorts to do their Parts towards it. I shall begin at the Meanest, and so ascend; and I <hi>beseech God,</hi> that the inward Operation of his <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> may assist me herein, and work with me in the Hearts of those concerned, to create such a good Disposition as this thing requires.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Commons</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> they have good Reason to have a <hi>Kindness</hi> for this <hi>CITY,</hi> as the Place where the more Ingenious of their Children may come to much better Fortunes then ever they could hope by their following the Plow: It hath been known by <hi>Experience,</hi> that many such who have come hither with scarce a Penny in their Purses, or Shoe to their Foot, that have here found such Ways to Improve their <hi>Genius,</hi> as hath raised them to a Great Estate, and changed their <hi>Pesantry</hi> for <hi>Gentility;</hi> yea sometimes they have Mounted their <hi>Posterity</hi> even to the State of <hi>Nobility:</hi> And the very Conceit of this, (which may be the <hi>Fate</hi> of one man as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) should make every man willing to Give or Pay so small a matter as this thing would require, if a <hi>Tax</hi> were Generally and Equally laid. But besides, the <hi>Country</hi> is Obliged to this by multiplied <hi>Kindnesses</hi> of like nature received from us; I believe for every Shilling we should need from them, in this matter, many Pounds hath been given here on <hi>Briefs</hi> for <hi>Fires, Building</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> and other <hi>Good Works</hi> to be done in the <hi>Country,</hi> towards which more is usually Expected from this <hi>City</hi> then from some <hi>whole Counties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:37329:100"/>2. In the former Head is included much that also concerns the Willingness of the Citizens of other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to assist in this Work, for that their Children are oftner sent hither then bred at home, and do here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at better Fortunes (if they be Industrious and Diligent) then by following their Trades in the Cities they were born in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Nobles and Gentry; This City, and its adjacent places, hath been their <hi>Paradise of Pleasure,</hi> the <hi>Repository</hi> for their <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Treasure,</hi> their chief <hi>Wardrobe</hi> and <hi>Magazine,</hi> the <hi>Receptacle</hi> for their <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> when it was meet to send them from the Aspiring Heir that was to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Family. Besides, this City hath created so many Noble and Genteel Families, and Educates most of their Sons in Her <hi>Inns-of-Court,</hi> to be fi for <hi>Justices</hi> in the Country; <hi>Judges, Councellors, States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Chief Justices</hi> in our <hi>Courts of Judicature;</hi> and it teacheth the way very often to the younger Sons to out-strip the elder Brother in Estate and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: This is a City, where many of the Fathers of Country-Gentlemen have been Lord-Mayors, and many of their Sons may be so; therefore sure it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want their help, either as private Gentlemen and Nobles, or as Parliament-men, when called by the <hi>KING,</hi> to give him Counsel for the Welfare and Prosperity of His Government.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may be more then hoped, that his most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Majesty, that never denied the Help he could give to any distressed Creature, when they sought it at his Hands, that hath given, even unasked, more to his Subjects at his first Restauration, then could be hoped, and even so much, that the Parliament (which is the Nations Representative) refused some Things lest, we should be Rampant and Unruly: I say,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37329:100"/> it may be more then hoped, that such a Majesty will most readily attend to the Complaints of this City, which is the most <hi>Royal Chamber</hi> of that <hi>Great House</hi> He is <hi>Master</hi> of, and will most willingly set to His Mighty Hand to help Repair the Decays of it, and Restore it to its Ancient Glory and Opulency; and from his Help much may be hoped: His <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> also, now consisting of Persons of such great Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency for Wisdom, Goodness, and Activity in <hi>Good Works</hi> as can scarcely be parallel'd in any Age, will doubtless give all the Aid they are able in the Distress of this Government, wherein some of their Ancestors have been, and many of their Children and Remains hereafter may be chiefly concerned.</p>
                  <p>But although Help mey be hoped from all those foregoing, as believing themselves concerned on such general Obligations as I have mentioned; yet more then ordinary may be expected from some that have special Obligations to this Thing; Those are first such as are obliged by Gratitude to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> for preserving them from Losses by this Insolvency of the <hi>Chamber:</hi> Thousands there are, that might have had their Estates there, which now lose nothing. I put this first, because it is my own particular Concern and Obligation in this matter; for tho I lose not one Farthing, as things now stand, yet I might have lost almost all, and that very probably: I have been long in a very infirm state, and but a little before the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this Poverty of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> I was so near death, that I was given up by my Physicians as past hope of Recovery: my Wife so well perswaded of the Cities Security, as to resolve not only to let all her Childrens Portions, but also her own part of my Estate to lie in the <hi>Chamber</hi> at Interest. Now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37329:101"/> but think that <hi>God Almighty</hi> doth expect this from me, in Return of this Great Mercy, whereby my Estate is preserved, and the Distress and Poverty of my Family prevented; That I should do somewhat extraordinary towards the Satisfaction of those who are there insnared to their great loss, and it may be to their utter ruine; and I hope this may plead some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in my defence for this publick motion, against those who may charge it as a bold underrtaking: And I am resolved it shall engage me to do my part to the good Example of others, if ever the Thing be set on foot. Now how many Thousands will come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Obligation, and if men by serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would but take this bond upon them, I might hope to draw them effectually to assist this Thing with all their Interests and Abilities.</p>
                  <p>But 2ly, The Greatest Obligation of all lies on Those in whom the Government of the City hath Subsisted from the time that this Insolvency first Commenced, the persons of the Living, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of the Deceased.</p>
                  <p>These, besides their Concern in the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Obligations, have one Greater than any of them; and that is, the Expression of their Repentance for what they have done to bring this loss, or rather not done to prevent it: And here I think it not unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to enquire into their Guilt, and to assist that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without which it can never be expunged; and to shew that without this Fruit, such Repentance is vainly pretended, and this may, I hope, have a good Influence also on the Government of the City for the future.</p>
                  <p>I shall observe therefore, that in these Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Guilt that is Contracted by one Generation,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37329:101"/> Devolves it self unto all Posterity, in that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the same in whomsoever it subsists, unless the Sins thereby committed, being considered and owned by the Body in general, every one do ask pardon at the hands of God, and do what he requires unto their Cleansing and Absolution as far as they are able; or unless, being discovered by particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before they are committed, they do forbear such voluntary Union or Communion in what is evil: And although most will plead Ignorance in this and such like Cases, yet, if that Ignorance proceed from a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness of doing their duty, and such sinful Self-love, as I have before reproved, it can be no Excuse or Extenuation of the Fault: For since every one that becomes a Member of any Society, contracts a Duty thereby, he ought to concern himself how he doth perform the same. Now it must be the duty of all Incorporations, as well as of all single persons, to do justly, and not injure or oppress any, what power or advantage soever they have so to do; and, to prevent such injury, to consider their own Ability and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state so far, as not to run in Debt, nor to undertake that which they are not able to perform; not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themselves that which they are not, not to take up or retain a Power or Trust which is prejudicial to the Incorporation, or to those that are related unto them: Now as this is Evident in its own Light, so it doth most plainly discover the Fault of those, who being as the Eyes and Hands of this Body-Corporate, did not inspect the state of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> so as at the first to discover the Decay of its Treasure, and Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to answer its Trust, and look into the Causes thereof, and (long before the Balance of its Account made it a Debtor) did not Concern themselves how
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37329:102"/> they might have been removed, their Stock preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and re-inforced, and made able to answer those Ends of Governmenr for which it is of absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that such a Stock there be, and without which such Incorporations cannot subsist, (except they live by Rapine and Spoyl of others) especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that such Poverty is a temptation unto theft, (even to Corporations, as well as to private Persons) as is observed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.9. And I most Earnestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all Incorporations this Care in the matter of Stock and Treasure, because I find that it is much neglected by all Societies, not only Civil, but Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical also. It is at this time a great Grief to me to observe the Poverty of many Parishes, but especially of our own in respect of their Common Stock, while the Parishioners are wealthy; so that things most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Honour and Service of God, for due performance of Holy Offices, and decent keeping the Places and Utensils of Divine Worship, cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, but by acciden al and precarious ways, and such as have much Inconvenience, if not some Evil in them; (this by the by.)</p>
                  <p>It was certainly a great Fault if the prospect of a great Income of Orphans and others on trust, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the Care and Consideration aforesaid; for tho this might be made use of to answer those ends, yet since if private men should purpose to get a Credit and Reputation, and then use it to take others Estates to maintain Themselves and Families, and take no care to get a Stock and Estate of their own to that use. I say't would be reckon'd a very Evil Design, and the Actors but a kind of Thieves, and I think Thieves of the worst kind, now therefore that the Chief City of this Kingdom should propose to it self to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37329:102"/> maintain all the Grandeur and Glory that belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and the vast Charges that must occur to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof by such Money, when they could never reasonably hope that being once expended in that manner, they should any way be able to raise a Stock to satisfie their Debts: I say, this is a most shameful thing, and not to be mentioned if it could be Concealed. But the Thing is now Notorious, we that are Free men of this City, must know it to our shame; and, if I did travel abroad in the World, I should expect to hear it often cast in my Teeth with Reproach, and it will be an everlasting Blot to all that bear the Name of <hi>Citizens of London,</hi> that ever such a thing was known; and it is not a sufficient Excuse to say, <hi>The thing is common;</hi> for that although it be too true (and more common I am afraid among <hi>Christians,</hi> than with <hi>Infidels,</hi> and will be found to be oftner in <hi>London,</hi> than in any City in the World, and in this last age, than in any that went before) yet the Government is never the more innocent: The end of such Government is, not that they should be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in Sin, or Patrons of any evil Custom, but that they should prevent and reform such. It was once a very sad Lamentation, <hi>That the faithful City was become an Harlot; it was full of Judgment, Righteousness lodged in it, but now Murderers. That her Princes were rebellious, and Comapnions of Thieves, that they oppressed the Fatherless, and judged not the Cause of the Widow,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 1.22. And I appeal to wise-men, Whether there be not too much Cause for such a Heavy Complaint against this once Famous City upon this occasion. But to divert my Reader a little, and because I think it may give some light in this matter, and make way for pressing Repentance
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37329:103"/> the more effectually on all that have been this way guilty; I will here make a Digression about <hi>Bankers,</hi> and <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> those Thieves that may here be meant, with whom we have had too much Company and Communion; being also desirous to give an end to a thing which hath proved more pernicious to Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans, and weak people (that have needed to make some Improvement of what Money was left them by their friends, or gotten by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) then either of the former Accedents; to do this I think may well come into the number of <hi>Good Works.</hi>

                              <p>THere hath been vast Sums lost by persons pretending (at first) to such an Art of Improvement, that they could allow 5 or 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Money, <hi>though it were not engaged for any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time,</hi> but to be called for by the Owners when ever they had need of it. This was so great a Conveniency for those that had Money by them, reserved for Uses that might not presently Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, that it grew to a mighty Trade, and they that used it are now Debters in vast Sums which they cannot pay: But since, when some of the first sort had so broke for great Sums, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder have brought <hi>it to time certain,</hi> but still pretend to the former Art, and that they can allow 5 or 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for as much Money as they can get, and make a Trade of putting it out or using it to advantage; and this is so desperable a thing to those that have Money, especially to Widows and Fatherless, and such as have not the Art to Improve Money themselves, that they are willing to believe it against all sense and reason, and will not be warned of the Cheat by the greatest Experience. In pity to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37329:103"/> these; and even to Bankers themselves, that have Contracted so great Guilt by Cheating in this way; and for the preventing so great Scandal as hereby must redound to Religion; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing the Church by admitting such to the Sacaament (which I think ought not to be) and for other good purposes: I will here offer my thoughts on this matter to publick view, humbly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those that are able Casuists among us, that if I err, they will rectifie me; If I am right, that they will inforce the thing as a matter both seasonable and profitable.</p>
                              <p>I shall therefore lay this as the Foundation of my Discourse: <q>1. That it is utterly unlawful for any man to pretend to that which is not true, whether he do it by Words or Actions: And 2ly, That it is great Injustice to Promise and give Bond, when we do not know we are able to perform; much more when we know the contrary. And 3ly, That the greater the Mischiefs are that are consequent to such pretences and promises, the greater is the Guilt of those that make them.</q>

                                 <hi>TRUTH</hi> is the best and most Glorious Thing in the World, the Foundation of that Confidence, without which there can be no Conversation among men: That Name of God, which obligeth us to ascribe Greatness unto him, (as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4.) is, <hi>He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he.</hi> If he were not a <hi>Rock, (i. e.)</hi> a sure Foundation of our Hope and Confidence) he could not be our God, and, <hi>if his work were not perfect, and his ways judgment,</hi> he could not be <hi>a Rock;</hi> and if he were not <hi>a God of Truth, and without iniquity, just and right,</hi> his <hi>works</hi> could not be <hi>perfect, and his ways judgment:</hi> This shews the Excellency of <hi>Truth, Justice, and Righteousness.</hi> Therefore the Sentence of the third of the wise young men, <hi>Esdras</hi> 4. was worthily magnified by <hi>Darius</hi> and his Council, and there is a mighty strength of Reason in his Discourse, for he argueth thus; He that made the Greatest Things in Nature must be greatest, as Men and Women, which are in their kinds strongest; the Earth that is greatest, the Heavens that are highest, the Sun that is swiftest of all things, <hi>Verse</hi> 34, 35. and he takes it for a thing evident in it self, and known to all men; <hi>that Truth was the very Essence and Nature of</hi> that <hi>Mighty Creator</hi> of all these. <hi>Falshood</hi> is a Contradiction to <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Reality,</hi> an Appearance of that which is not; and therefore God being an <hi>Infinite Essence, Reality, sure Foundation,</hi> &amp;c. (which is included in his Name <hi>The Rock</hi>) he must be <hi>the God of Truth.</hi> 3ly, He sheweth that all men desire <hi>Truth,</hi> and they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37329:104"/> highly praise it; they would not worship a God that would be false to them, nor deal with men that should prove Cheats, <hi>(i. e)</hi> without truth. 4ly, That all evil things fear and tremble at it, as that which will shame and punish them at the last. 5ly, That there is no unrighteous thing with it, but perfect Goodness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds its very Nature and Essence, <hi>Verse</hi> 36. And 6ly, That all things (how great or beautiful, how strong and powerful soever they seem in their kind) as Wine, Women, and all the Children of Men, are but weak compared with Truth, and such are all their works, and in their unrighteousness they shall perish, <hi>Verse</hi> 35. 7ly, That <hi>Truth</hi> endureth. and is always strong, liveth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth for Everlasting, <hi>Verse</hi> 34. 8ly, <hi>Truth</hi> is Impartial, not excepting Persons or Rewards, but doing Justice to all, so that all are pleased and like well of her works, and, in that she doth refrain from all unjust and wicked things, and admit no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness in Judgment, she is the Strength, Kingdom, Power, and Majesty of all Ages and Generations of men, <hi>Verse.</hi> 39, 40. Then he concludes with this Decalogy, <hi>Blessed be the God of Truth.</hi> Thus you see the Excellency of Truth, without which God could not be God; nor can there be any stability, security, unity, prosperity, and joyful satisfactions among men. Now if I prove that the Thing I oppose is a Contradiction to <hi>Truth,</hi> and one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Contradictions, that is used as a Profession and Trade, among men, I doubt not but I shall render it a thing so Ill, as deserves greater Indignation than my words, either before or in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, do express.</p>
                              <p>The Inquiries to be made to this purpose, are, 1. <hi>What it is that those who are called Bankers, (viz.</hi> Such as set up to make a Trade of taking up Money at 5 or 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and then to trade with it, or put it out again for profit.) I say, <hi>What is it that such pretend to? and whether such their Pretences be Consistent with Truth?</hi> 2ly, <hi>Whether they do not know when they give their Notes and Bonds, that if all those to whom they promise, or are bound, should require them to do accordingly, they could not perform the same? And whether this be Consistent with Truth?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>For the first of these, I think all men apprehend, that such Bankers pretend by words and actions, that their Security is good, and that such as trust their Money with them, may rest confident that they shall have it again. Now how can this consist with Truth, when so many of them have broke, and let their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and all the World know, that their Pretences were but for a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37329:104"/> Cheat. I have heard men, otherwise prudent, tell such stories of the fine ways these men have pretended for improving their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of the great strength of that Security on which they let it out again; <hi>(viz.</hi> That it was as firm as the Iron Chest they could keep it in at home, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that it hath made me smile at the Falacy, which yet I could not convince them of, until their own Experience made them wiser; and that the very persons they were so Confident of, broke and never paid them half their Debts: One would think it very strange, that when men of greatest Sense, and most generous Education, cannot find ways to make Five in the Hundred of their Moneys without danger of losing it, but that often it lies by them some years together without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. I say, that when this is so (as all know that so it is) that those Bankers (who are not the wisest of men, or of the best breeding for ought I can find) should have a reach beyond all the World in this matter. I have heard indeed, that some of the first sort of Bankers have made twenty, thirty, yea, forty in the Hundred of their Money in former times; but 'twas to the great damage of the Publick, or to the ruine of such necessitous persons as gave such allowance for the loan of Moneys; yet for all that, they are all broke and gone off the Stage with dishonour. Our present Bankers can scarce pretend to such vast Improvements, yet they will insinuate that some secret ways they have, (that no body knows but themselves) which are of great advantage; but some of these have gone off too; and being forced to shew their Books, have opened the mystery, and shewed that such pretences were but a Cheat, and that they had found nothing but what others knew, only they would venture with others Money, that which no wise man would do with his own, and trust out Thousands on Security that no man would take for Hundreds; sometimes Ten or fifteen Thousand pounds to one man, or to two or three which are made one by Combination, of whom they could ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>er get five shillings in the pound; and these Bankers have been such as have pretended to great Wariness and Circumspection in lending their Money: so that I have thought it impossible (till Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence convinced me to the contrary) that they should be so rash and venturous; but it is such a Temptation to have a great Bank of Money at Interest, that 'tis no wonder that they catch at all offers of profit, and that without consideration of the conjoyned hazards. But let us hear what these men say for themselves when they are broke and the Cheat is detected; They tell us, they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37329:105"/> had an implicite Consent of their <hi>Creditors</hi> to run such hazards as was cause of their breaking; for that <hi>they</hi> could not think any could allow them Interest, but in order to let it out to profit, and that could not be without great hazard, which hazard therefore, by putting their Money into their hands, they consented to run; and if losses come, it is but reason they should bear them. Here they talk backward; they said in their prosperity, <hi>That their ways were sure, and their Security good,</hi> and he that but demurr'd at their Note or Bond, was a scrupulous Coxcomb, and one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive word was enough to make them throw up your Money, and tell you they had rather be without it, and none greater Huffs than these; but now <hi>Every body knew our Security was bad, and our ways hazardous,</hi> and they were willing to be Cheated, and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti non fit injuria.</hi> But suppose their Creditors were so silly as to believe their Security good, and that they had such ways to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improve Money, that they could allow them Interest and get by it, (as men are apt to believe as they would have it) or were so good natur'd, as having no knowledge of them or obligation to them, (as most had not) to trust them with their Money at such hazards; I dare say few Casuists will judge it is consistent with Truth, or Goodness and Charity, to take advantage of their simplicity, and to deceive their confidence in them; God expects we should be like him in this, as well as in other things; in <hi>viz.</hi> being so faithful, that none <hi>that putteth their trust in us should be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it,</hi> and if we be not, we are none of his Children. And this induceth the second Inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether these Bankers do not know when they give their Bonds, that it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they can do accordingly; and whether this consisteth with Truth and Righteousness.</p>
                              <p>In answer to this, let it be considered, When men give Bonds and Notes for forty, fifty, yea, a hundred thousand pounds; how they should think to satisfie so many as must be supposed may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come due at one time; if they should keep such a Bank of Money by them as is needful for this, they must let out or improve the rest to vast profit, or else be great Losers, and if they do not, (as to be sure they never intend it) they must know when they give their Bonds or Notes, that, if they be demanded when due, they cannot pay them; and therefore such Bankers have a Lye in their right hand, when they sign and deliver such Bonds, and their Creditors the same when they receive them. If it be said, that their Creditors must needs know this as well as they; the Answer
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37329:105"/> must be as before, that their venturing to be Cheated is no excuse for those who make such use of their rashness and folly: This little is enough to shew how great a Contradiction this Trade is to <hi>Truth,</hi> that glorious and excellent thing wherewith Christians should have the <hi>loyns of their minds always girded about,</hi> that they may be strong and vigorous in the exercises of their Religion: <hi>That,</hi> without which all pretences to Religion are but a Cheat, and the power of performing the Exercises of it will be but weakness. How much the Word of God in general, and the Gospel in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is concerned in this matter of requiring Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in all men, especially Christians, these few Texts, of many that might be produced, can witness, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.11, 13. <hi>Ye shall not deal falsly, neither lye one to another: thou shalt not defraud thy Neighbour.</hi> Col. 3.9. <hi>Lye not one to another, seeing you have put off the old man,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 26.7. <hi>The way of the Just is uprightness. Thou most upright dost weigh the path of the just,</hi> 1 John 3.18. <hi>My little Children, let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi> Zech. 18.16. <hi>Speak every one the truth to his Neighbour: execute the judgment of truth. Let none imagine evil in his heart against his Neighbour.</hi> Ephes. 4.25. <hi>Therefore putting away lying, speak every one truth to his Neighbour, for you are members one of another. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.</hi> -5.9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Who shall ascend unto the Hill of God? He that walketh uprightly, worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth, and doth no evil to his Neighbour.</hi> 1 Thes. 4.6. <hi>Let no man go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or defraud his brother in any matter, because God is the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of such, as we have forewarned you and testified.</hi> In which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations you see how the Old Testament and the New eccho to each other in declaring the truth of this matter, that the greatest plainness, honesty, uprightness, and integrity should be used in mens Dealings one with another, and that none should seek their own advantage to his Neighbours prejudice. Now to this, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the pretences and promises aforesaid to be directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and so very unlawful.</p>
                              <p>But 3ly, The Evils and Mischiefs consequent to this way of Trade make the unlawfulness of it more manifest: For, first it is unlawful for him that hath engaged in the Christian Warfare, so to <hi>incumber himself in the Affairs of this life,</hi> as this Trade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; at least except he could have no other way to live, or that some greater reasons, then the desire of living high, moved him thereunto. The Christian that understands <hi>his Religion,</hi> knows the rewards of Vertue proposed <hi>therein,</hi> to be so far above
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37329:106"/> that of worldly Pomp and pleasure, that he will never willingly choose a State prejudicial to the former, only because 'tis advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the latter; but if he can live and maintain his Family in a mean state, with freedom of his mind and good advantage of prosetuting the <hi>Glory, Honour, and Immortality</hi> praeposed in the Gospel, he prefers it far before the bravest state with disquiet of mind and hazard of his Soul: For my part I find that a due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a small Estate (not worth the Tenth of what these men undertake the Improvement of) is a very great disturbance, and is accompanied with many Avocations from the things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be done in the prosecution aforesaid; and yet men that have Esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>: And I do not know any of these Bankers, but that, if 3 or 4 of their greatest Creditors should at any time agree to demand what they owe them at the same time, they were not able presently to pay them, and if not, they are at their Mercy, (for I believe none would Bail them for Ten Thousand Pound) and then I have observed also, that upon many Accidents Men are apt to conceive a suspicion of these that owe them great Sums, and so it hath been very often in my Remembrance, and that the more there are of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37329:106"/> rest, and, if but one great Merchant or Banker break, all Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Merchants become suspected of being so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with them, that it impairs their Credit for a time; and if but one man be over jealous, though without cause, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest one of these publickly, or if any out of spleen should do so, it would alarm many more, and bring Actions so fast as might overwhelm the best of them: By all which it is evident, how these men part with the security of their persons and quiet of their minds, out of desire to seem great and rich in this World.</p>
                              <p>But thirdly, The worst mischief of all is, that in this Trade, men make the Eternal Salvation of their Souls so extreamly diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, that it is next to impossible; For not only the infinite thoughts and business that accompany the management of so great a Treasure, must hinder that composed state of mind which is needful for a Christian to prosecute his Salvation withal, and the Cares and Vexations consequent to the Hazards and Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments to which such business is subject, will distract the mind and make it yet more unfit for that purpose; and the giving such Interest for Money makes men apt to Extortion and unreasonable Impositions on men in their necessities, and to undertake very hazardous Enterprizes, and to take such Securities as may prove worth nothing (if there be but a possibility of great gain if things luck well) and this debauches their Consciences, or makes their Reason look sourly on them, so that they love not to enter into themselves, and converse with their own Minds, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abroad and out of themselves, which those must not be that will save their Souls eternally. I say, not only this (which I have hinted before) but there is that in it which makes their Salvation ten times more difficult yet, and that is this; When men have set up themselves in a high state and rank, and have been counted the best men in the Parish, when they have been Companions for the Greatest, and courted and address'd, on several accounts, as if they were some Great Ones. I say, if after this, Misfortunes come, that their Trade be spoiled, and the bottom must be wound up till they see the end of it; if it then appear that they have but <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>ust enough to pay their Debts, or that it falls much short; and <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>
                                 </gap>f yet it appear that their Debts must be paid (at least to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that they are able) or else they can never be saved; in that <hi>He that borroweth and payeth not again is a wicked man,</hi> Psal. 37.21. <hi>And the unrighteous shall never inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. And he that detains that which is another mans, is as truly a Thief as he that steals it; and such Thieves and covetous men
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37329:107"/>
                                 <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.10. And much more that might be said to prove this, but that every body knows or may know it if they will, <hi>That no man can hope to be forgiven of God that persist wilfully in sins against men,</hi> as they do who will not pay as far as they are able. Now I say, if this be so, how hard will it be for these men, that have ridden in their Coaches, and kept a Port like Princes, to come down and sit on the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill with Beggers, to divest themselves of all that ever they have to pay their Debts, though they and theirs go a begging after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; nay, which is more, to lay themselves and theirs at the feet of their Creditors, to be their Vassals, and by them to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of to their utmost advantage towards their satisfaction: And yet thus I have heard some Casuists say, it must be if they will make their Election to Eternal Salvation sure and certain; and I confess I cannot but doubt of the Salvation of those that think this, or any thing else, too much to do for an Eternal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city if God require it: But 'tis certainly extream hard to flesh and blood so to do, especially when the flesh is made delicate and tender by the Indulgence aforesaid; and because it is so, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Trade must be unlawful. I know this Pill will hardly down, something men will do towards the paying their Debts, because, except they make some assays to be Just, they cannot bribe their Consciences to be quiet, or be indured and tolerated among men; but men will hardly come up to the heights of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, though, if they do not, all is but a paliat cure. I have known some that will pay part of their Debts, but not all, (not all that they are at present able;) some the whole, but not then when it is due, but at long run; some the Principal, but no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and some neither one or the other, without a full Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and perfect security of future liberty and freedom. All these come short of doing what they should, or what they can; for they should pay all that is due, both Principal and Interest, and pay it when it is due, and pay without such Capitulation; and they can do what they can do of this; they can pay all they have, they can give themselves and theirs, as far as they have right in both; they can promise to do no more hereafter, if more they shall ever be able: and if they do neither what they should, nor what they can; they are unjust and unrighteous, and for such there is no Heaven. I am sorry to see men will not take more heed, <hi>They lose not the things they have wrought;</hi> according to the Precept, 2 <hi>John</hi> 8. which certainly they do not, when, for want of doing all they can, that which they do is to no purpose.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37329:107"/> If a man owe me twenty pounds, and is able to pay, but he will pay me but nineteen, nor will he pay that neither, except I will give him a discharge for the whole Twenty; I should think it my prudence rather to take it and discharge him, than go to Law: but he that pays so, loseth his Conscience and Credit as much as if he had paid never a Groat: The Application is plain if men will make it, if not, I cannot help it, I have discharged my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and do appeal to the Ministers of Christ (who are not to conceal any Divine Counsels needful to be known for the Salvation of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27.) whether I am right or wrong, and if they shall judge me to have err'd, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>I know some will retort on me with the old Proverb, <hi>['Tis an ill Bird that bewrays his own Nest.]</hi> And I would easily confess my self could be no good man, if it could be proved that I did any real prejudice to my own Fraternity and Profession; but I believe I do not: For first, Banking is no real and fundamental part of the same; yea, 'tis so alien from it, that it is most true, that one of the Chief of them once told me, <hi>They are no Goldsmiths,</hi> for they, having espoused a new Trade, cast off the old, and cannot attend it, and many of them scorn to own the chief parts of it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That of Banking which only is lawful, I do offer to prove to be more fit and easie for Goldsmiths than for any sort o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That which I so think then to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and fit in this matter, is this; First, That if any Country Gentleman or Citizen have Money to receive and pay, a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith may undertake to do it for them, as being best able to know what Money is good or bad. 2ly, That he may undertake to secure it in his house, or other place, against Fire and Robbery, And 3ly, He may so use the said Money, that he may always have in readiness either Money, or such Effects, as the Owners may see and have them put into their possession in a moment of time, when ever any Jealousies make them to question their Credit. Now this a Goldsmith only can do, because he, dealing in Bullion and Jewels, may by buying such things, or lending Money on them at easie rates, have always by him that which will satisfie
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37329:108"/> those that trust him; and it may be supposed, that if he pay no Interest, (as I am sure no man can afford to do, nor was it ever the Custom in former times, but men were rather gratified for Receiving and Paying.) I say, that then they may, by such Trade in Buying and Lending, get so much as may compensate for their Pains and Charge in keeping Servants and Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said thus much, I now return.</p>

                  <p>IT is, I say, a thing much to be lamented, that the Government of such a City should give any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to any thing of this nature, whereby men should be insnared by false pretences and appearances, to their loss and undoing, or that any, from observing the working of things in the Affairs of the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> should take occasion of such a Conceit as this. <hi>I see there is a way wherein a man that is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nay, though he owe much more then he is worth, may have great Credit and live high in the world, and as things may hap, he may be honest and pay his Debts, and get an Estate; but if not, he having vast Sums in his hands, may reserve enough to live better than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that this can be no great Reproach, since the Chamber it self must once come to that, as to Compound its Debts, and send thousands away dissatisfied, that come to demand their due.</hi> And yet who knows but that some ill men that knew the state of the Chamber, might long ago have such a Conceit, and thereupon give beginning to this naughty Trade of Banking, which hath done so much hurt.</p>
                  <p>But I know it will be said, Alas, what should the Government of the City have done when they first discovered this? It was a hard case for this Famous City to do as I have heard the King of <hi>Spain</hi> once did, <hi>viz.</hi> to declare themselves <hi>Insolvent;</hi> that is to say; poor and unable to pay what they had borrowed;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37329:108"/> I confess it was so, but it had been a thousand times more honest and praise-worthy so to have done, than to have Concealed the Thing, and make shew of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency, and of being Excellent good Security, and to have drawn infinite Sums into their hands, which should be spent in Magnificence and Pagentry in Feasting, and other Bravery, to their own dishonour and eternal reproach, and to the great loss, if not ruine of those that intrusted them: Not that I blame those things absolutely, for I know that Grandure and Magnificence is necessary for the ends of Government, but it ought otherwise to be provided for, and if the Government, being sensible first of their great damage by paying such Interest to Orphans, and of the decay of their Stock by that and other ways, and also consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their Inability to maintain the necessary charge of the Government; had represented the same in Common-Coucil, and petition'd the King to inable them to provide by an Equal Tax on all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Great Body, or by asking the free Gift, or Loan of the more Wealthy Citizens, till the Thing could have been accomplished, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. I say, if they had in this, or any other good way, provided to maintain the necessary Grandure of the City, it had been a worthy thing; but to imploy Money taken on Credit to that purpose, when no way appeared how it should afterward be paid, was very evil.</p>
                  <p>It seems to me, that nothing can be pleaded in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this that may bear any such weight as to make the Balance stand right: Ignorance cannot be pleaded, because there must be such an exact method of keeping Accounts in all such great Concerns, as will discover whether Debtor or Creditor be uppermost in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37329:109"/> the Balance; or at least, if any that are concerned in such a Government may truly plead Ignorance, they cannot plead Innocence; for it must be a great fault in such not to be concerned, whether the <hi>Chamber</hi> be rich or poor, just or unjust, a Security to such as trust them, or a Gulf to swallow all that is cast in there (as it would be if the vast Expences to which it is subject be desrayed by such Moneys) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such men be so unconcern'd, it seems impossible to me that Ignorance can be by them truly pleaded. Now I have shewn before the Obligation of such our relation to Incorporations, and that God will exact an Account thereof; and indeed he doth seldom dispense wich such Faults in this world, because here only these Bodies do subsist, and there is no resurrection of the dead to such Incorporations, or any life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting for them to be punished in as such, only God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Repentance unto these, and if they repent (as such) and bring forth meet fruits, they may long stand in this world; but if not, God lays his Ax to their Roots, and cuts them down: But he is long suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and spares them three years <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a great while first, as long as there is any probability; nay, and after that another year, and makes a second tryal by digging and dunging about them, and spares as long as it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to conceive hope of fruit; and so he hath done by us, 'tis a shame to tell the date from which some say, this Insolvency of the City hath commenced, and all this time we should have considered it, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Causes of the decay of its Treasure, and the Consequences of spending the Stock of poor Orphans that were put (or rather taken) into the Chamber, and taking Money of others at Interest, when they were unable to pay; (but as they robbed <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:37329:109"/> to pay <hi>Paul</hi>) and, considering this, should have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the very first fit opportunity to have declared the matter, and sought help in the Case: and many an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity they have had; but my-thinks there was one that mightily inhanseth their Guilt not to have taken, and that was, When the Parliament first quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with the King in confidence of the Cities Aid; for if the wisest and best of the Governors of this City had declared to that Parliament the vast Charge that must occur to this Chamber, by assisting them in a War against their King, and their Inability to do it, but with the livelihood of those poor Orphans and others that they were intrusted with; (too much of which had been expended already) and had made use of this Consideration to have depressed the Causes and Incentives to that War, 'tis like the Parliament would never have ventured to ingage the Nation in that rebellious and destructive War. But alass, how justly hath the Royal Martyr complained of our Madness and Folly at that time, in permitting Riots and Tumults to the affronting of Himself and all his Friends, and heartning and provoking his Enemies to abuse and persecute Him, and running headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unnecessary and chargeable War, to the ruine of themselves and the Nation, (if miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had not prevented it:) 'Tis this I fear hath greatly increased the Debt of this City, and so deeply ingraven that Character of the Prophet in the place fore-mentioned, and that in both respects, that it is beyond all excuse and extermination, and hath been the greatest cause, as I believe, of the overthrow of its Charter, which might have had worse effects, but for a Gracious King, then most men imagin'd.</p>
                  <p>But now, it may be, some may think that there is no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37329:110"/> Obligation lies on the past Governours or their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this matter, but that all is dissolved with their Charter; and if so, the King had done them a great kindness indeed, and my present Argument were use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, but I think it is not so, for their Action was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, and so must the Guilt be, and so continues as as long as they are persons, however their relation to the Government cease; for I have reason to think that as the possession of that Relation could be no Reward for their well-doing, but only the occasion of it, and that which laid the foundation of a future reward, if so they had answered the ends and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations thereof; so the dissolution of that relation cannot be esteemed any competent punishment for the neglect of their Duty and for their causing the infinite mischiefs consequent on it; for so it is in the relations of Father and Son, Husband and Wife, and all others Oeconomical, National, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, and for the miscarriages in all of them, however the relations be dissolved, shall most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be punish'd in this World, in the next, or in both, if we do not repent and bring forth meet fruits, which, in the case under consideration, is the doing whatever we are able, with Person and Purse, to heal the Wounds and Evils that such our neglects and male-administrations occasioned, and to prevent the like for the future, by Confession to God, Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to men, and Condemnation of our selves, for having so offended. And this is the thing I chiefly drive at, that those men who are lately discharged from the Government, should think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, for all that, to assist to the uttermost in this work; and I believe a due sense of their miscarriages in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the expression of such a temper as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37329:110"/> becomes them under the just displeasure of God and their Prince, would bring them again into favour with both, and be infinitely more to their own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the review, then a <hi>sullen discontent;</hi> a thing that may expose them to very bad temptation, and beget inward trouble and vexation at the last.</p>
                  <p>How far the Posterity of those that have been of old concern'd in this Government, and through their male-administration became guilty: I say, how they are obliged in a special regard, is a harder question. But since God visits the Iniquities of the Fathers on their Children, and since those that would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freed from the Guilt of their Forefathers, should in reason declare they are not such a Posterity as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their sayings; and since no better way they can do it then in assisting most freely in the Case before us; methinks those rich men that know, or but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly think their Progenitors had any hand in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City since its insolvency commenced, should take on themselves an Obligation to be more than ordinary free and forward in this case.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I shall only touch the Obligation of our present Governors, and so end.</p>
                  <p>These certainly are nearest unto the Guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of this Offence, though they may not have been the greatest Offenders; doubtless 'tis with the Government of a City, as well as with that of a Kingdom, <hi>That it never dies,</hi> and the Guilt remains as long as the Government, except it be some way discharged; and therefore these in whom it presently subsists are in great danger of present punishment if they do not their part for satisfying the Law of God, which shall not fail in any <hi>Iota.</hi> And indeed, by taking on them the Government, they take all that is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37329:111"/> inseparably affixed to it, good and bad; which should be well considered of those that take up the Gown: not that I discourage any man, for it is the most He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick thing that any man can do upon Earth, to take up Sin so as to bear it away, for God himself hath hereby made his Name glorious: and the greatest Glory that ever was acquired by men on Earth, hath this way been obtained. And if the present Court of Aldermen would so take on themselves the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and guilt of this great Offence whereby God and man hath been so much injured, and resolve on such confession and satisfaction to the uttermost of their power for the present, and for the future lessening themselves as much as the Government will bear, joyning with it a great diligence in their use of all just ways of reinforcing their Treasure for full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the last, and the most prudent Consideration, how such Folly and Injustice may for ever hereafter be prevented: I believe it would make their Memory eternal, and he that in reward of the most famous undertaking of this nature: (I mean that of our Lord) gave, <hi>A name above every name,</hi> will, I doubt not, make this Court honourable above all that have been before it if they heartily and throughly attend this thing; and I do humbly desire them when they bow their knees at the Adorable Name of <hi>JESUS,</hi> they will remember how honourable a thing it is for any man to be a Saviour to others, and serve God in regenerating a dead and corrupted World or City.</p>
                  <p>I suppose these cannot believe that the forfeiture of the City-Charter (on which some have been removed, and others taken their place, and some other Alterations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued) is such a dissolution of the Government, as that there should be no Obligation on the present Court of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37329:111"/> Aldermen to seek by all possible ways and means that are just and honourable, to Redress this Extream Grievance occasioned by fore-mentioned neglects of that Court; the City is still the same, and it is the whole body that is the debtor to these persons; &amp; since they are now become Head of this Body, they must be chiefly concerned to pay its Debts, if they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves good Christians, Citizens, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates. Let me humbly intreat them to consider this, and that they are now the Masters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of that Chamber that is thus Indebted, and so the Help of these distressed people is in them, and the Help that all others give in this case is given unto them, as those that are to do the thing; and can it be expected that any will help those, that will not do their best to help themselves? Certainly with no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Let me therefore beseech you, as a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, concerned for the honour of our most holy and charitable Religion, and as a good Citizen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Honour, Wealth, and future prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this City, once famous through the World and the Glory of our own Nation, loved and reverenced of all, now grown poor and contemptible to our selves, and to every body else; Let me beseech you to stir up in your selves the Affections of good Men, of good Citizens, and of good Christians, that all these may solicite and animate most serious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and your most vigorous Endeavours; making all the Interests you are able, and, by Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Petitions to those that may be able to help, or any other way that you can think of, to shew that you do so, and when you have stirred them up, do not let them cool again till the Work be done. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and a vigorous activity in so good a Work,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37329:112"/> proceeding from such Affection as before, and guided by such Wisdom as should be in Persons Eminent as Men, as Citizens, and as Christians: I say, such a Resolution is a mighty thing, and will bear down great Oppression, and attract like a Loadstone the help of all that are near it.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore I shall venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to those concerned in the Government of this City, who are sensible of former miscarriages, and desire to Restore the Honour and Wealth thereof: The first is a <hi>Declaration of Repentance;</hi> and 2ly, <hi>Hearty Endeavours to do among themselves what may be done by them in this Case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is some satisfaction to the miserable and afflicted, when those that have been Chief Instruments of their Miseries, do but confess their Fault, ask them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, lament their Sufferings, and endeavour an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends; and this is the least that Offenders in any kind can do; If one do but tread on anothers Toe and make him halt or cry out for pain, he cannot but cry him mercy and hold him from falling; and they that but casually wound any should endeavour to heal them again: And if for involuntary Offences men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect sorrow &amp; satisfaction, much more for those which might have been prevented; and it is Impudence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Injury, when men out-brave those they have hurt or wronged, or slight their sufferings as not to be regarded. I have heard it heavily complained of, that some Bankrupt Bankers kept up their port, and rode in state in their Coaches, attended as before, when so many were great Suffererers by their putting the Money lent them into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> thereby to raise themselves to that height, where it was now stopt; and may it not aggravate the sorrows of the many sad
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37329:112"/> Orphans, Widows, and others in this City, whose Whole is in the Chamber, to see no abatement of Pomp and Pleasures, of Feastings and Furniture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby too much Insensibility is declared, and the Money, that might do somewhat (if but a little) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their relief, is expended: Such as these are apt to think (and speak to) as if mourning Weeds, and Bread of Affliction better became the Debtors of those that must go in Rags and fare hardly, than such Pomp and State; but the greatest Offence is given hereby to God Almighty, who is injured and offended in this matter more then men; those that should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented him, as well in his Righteousness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as in his Majesty and Greatness, while they sate in the Seat of Government, when they have so grosly neglected it, and, being made his Deputies in the world to relieve the Oppressed, and to see that the Injured be restored to their right, are become Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors themselves, and have taken away so many Thousands from Orphans and Widows beyond any power of restoration by themselves, and I am afraid beyond any will of doing it by any body else: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly such should think themselves concerned to mourn, and not put on their Ornaments, as well as the offending <hi>Israelites,</hi> Exod. 33.4. For without this, the God of infinite Wisdom as well as Goodness, saith, <hi>He knew not what to do to them; (i. e.)</hi> not how to do any thing towards their relief and restoration, <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Whereas when he was highly provoked by that most villainous act of Injustice and Cruelty done by the wicked King <hi>Ahab</hi> against his good Subject <hi>Naboth,</hi> his displeasure was relaxed, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed punishment postponed, on the Offenders <hi>Rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Robes and lying in sackcloth,</hi> 1 Kin. 21. So
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37329:113"/> necessary are outward signs of Repentance for all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, whether Incorporations or single persons, for attoning the Justice of God, and for asswaging the displeasure of men.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I propose is a free Loan by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and chief Citizenss for a year or two, until there be a Parliament, with whose Advice, and by whose Authority, we may hope that his most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Majesty will make some Law for a more general and effectual way of Relief; 'tis true, we cannot hope that so much will be lent as may do any thing towards the satisfaction of the principal Debt, but yet we may hope, that which will give some present Relief to the Indigent and Distressed, and keep all in hope of a good end at the last: And here I cannot forbear to mention, to the honour of that worthy Citizen, Sir <hi>J. E.</hi> a Proposal, I am credibly informed, he made to this purpose in the Court of Aldermen, <hi>viz.</hi> That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the City was much indebted to him before, yet he would lend a Thousand pounds <hi>Gratis,</hi> for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, towards the bringing it out of Debt, and he believed there were a Hundred Men in the City that were as able as he to do the like, if they were but willing thereunto. Although I know not the worthy Gentleman, yet having heard this of him, just as I was writing this <hi>Appendix</hi> to my Letter, I thought my self obliged to mention it as the most effectual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of what I here propose: And I do not doubt but if the King's Majesty, and such a Loyal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we may once hope for, after the instruction we have had by much Experience of our mistakes in many matters of Church and State: I say if they saw the City so affected as they ought with the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Creditors, and so careful to do all they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37329:113"/> could possible themselves toward their help; they would doubtless afford such aid as would be fully sufficient in the case; and, by the blessing of God, might effectually wash off the Blot of former failings, and make this Government so Just and Righteous, so Wise and prudent, so Rich and Opulent, that it will recover the Honour and Grandeur it hath had in former Ages, when, as I have heard say, the Lord Mayor told one of our Warlike Kings, <hi>That if he should be taken Captive three times in that year, they could pay his Ransom:</hi> Then the Stock of poor Orphans might be securely deposited in their hands, and their fatherly care of them would be a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to their dying Parents, and all good men would be encouraged to assist in the Government.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have offered my sudden Thoughts to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view, in these two great Concerns; I confess I do it with some fear, because I seem to my self too little for the proposal of such Great Things; but yet with hope that the Integrity of my Mind, and freedom from all possible suspicion of any Secular Design or Interest in the thing, may preserve me from any great blame in the Case: And now I proceed.</p>
                  <p>The next sort of ways of imploying our selves in doing <hi>Good Works,</hi> are such as tend to the Relief of the Poor: The Poor are considerable in several Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; as poor Men and poor Christians: as poor by reason of natural Infirmity, and common Casuality, (to which all are subject) or by their own Idleness, Inconsiderateness, ambitious Adventures, Litigious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Luxury, and other Vices, which neither Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Disposition, nor Diabolical Temptations can force any man to, and therefore not so excusable but they must be acknowledged voluntary: The one sort are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37329:114"/> God's Poor, the other may be said, in a sense, to be the Devils; yet not so his neither, but that there is a Charity due to them as men, in order to their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in this life, and for effecting their repentance, that they may be saved at last; Christ is the Saviour of all men in a general sense, and even for the worst he hath done very much, and so should we. Now of these as most inferiour, but not the least difficult of these <hi>Good Works,</hi> I shall first speak one Phrase of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, whereby the Sin of Uncharitableness is condemned, is, <hi>That it is a hiding our selves from our own flesh,</hi> Isa. 58.7. Which infers, that there is a Charity due to all Mankind upon the account of our participation of the same Humane Nature, as they are the same flesh and blood as we our selves; in that they sprang from the same Parents at the first, and had the same Original of their being; and therefore those that have a greater kindness for their dogs and horses, than for such poor miserable men, offend against the Laws of Nature as well as Scripture; not but that men that are rich may keep and love these for the delight and service they have by them; but <hi>men</hi> (though never so miserable) should be loved of us on other accounts; they are not to be loved and relieved only that we may serve our selves of them, but that we may shew our sense of the Relation we have to them, as they are our Brethren and Neighbors; and upon this account it was that our Saviour commended the good <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> because he shewed he believed every man to be his Neighbor so far, as that when he saw one in misery whom he knew no otherwise then as a man, yet he relieved him, only for that reason; and did not as the Priest and Levite, who passed by as unconcerned, as if they had seen there but a dying beast, (it may be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37329:114"/> because they saw no character of his relation to their Nation or Religion, which was their <hi>Hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from their own flesh.</hi> We read of a <hi>Dives,</hi> who hid himself in his Banquetting house, when he should have appeared for the relief of a dying <hi>Lazarus</hi> that lay at his Gate full of Sores; while his Dogs were more neighbourly to him than he would be. The World is full of such unnatural rich men, who cannot endure to come nigh the miserable of their own kind: The Brutes shall rise in judgment against such, who are observed to assemble themselves, when they know, by the Cries, that any of their kind are in misery, and willingly run to their relief. But besides their relation to themselves, they have the same interest in God as their Creator, and in Christ as their Saviour, which the richest in the World have; for this being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their being men, <hi>The rich and poor are both alike, and both meet together,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> observes: God in Christ offereth the participation of his Grace and Salvation to both with the same freedom, and on the same conditions of Faith and Repentance; and without those the richest in the world shall be no more saved than the poorest: But in those the poor have some advantage, as such; for the Scripture speaks as if the very poverty and misery of mens state in this world gave them some singular respect with God and our blessed Saviour, and gave also great help to their repentance. I observed before, that 'tis one of God's glorious Attributes, that he saves the poor out of misery, and is the Comforter of the dejected; and Christ both pronounces a blessing to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.20. and preaches his Gospel to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5. in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, not that they shall actually partake of his Blessings and Evangelical Comforts, only on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37329:115"/> of their poverty without Faith and Repentance, but because the poverty and misery of their outward condition make them more meet Objects of the Divine Pity, and is more like to dispose them for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ's Grace than Riches and Glory in this world: And on this account they are more truly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed than the Rich and Pompous, in that they are in a nearer disposition to blessedness; and it will be an high aggravation of the sin I am reproving, that for that for which God and Christ had the greater respect to these, and was more propitious towards them, even for their poor estate in this world, I say that for that we should abhor them, and hide our selves from them. What though it may be said, that they brought themselves into misery by their own default: Have we not all done so with respect to God Almighty? But yet <hi>though our destruction be of our selves, yet our help is in him;</hi> and so should the help of these miserable Creatures be in us, if we would be like him. 'Tis true, that as the help of God consisted in putting us into such a state as that we might <hi>work out our own salvation,</hi> which we should do with <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> because if he once help us out of the state of Infirmity, wherein we had no strength for that work, and we afterward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse his Grace, and despise the infinite Benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to the good use of it, and wilfully cast our selves again into misery, there is no ground of hope for a second Grace. I say, as God deals thus with us, so the help that we afford to this sort of poor is in order to their Repentance, and to put them into a state wherein they may provide for themselves and Families, if it be not their own fault; which if the sense of their former misery, added to that of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do not perswade them to do in the best manner
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37329:115"/> they can, they have so far abandoned Reason, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Humanity, and chosen to herd with the beasts, in following their sensual appetites and passions (though to their ruine) and they should be dealt with as they are, and made work like Horses with a Yoak on their Necks, and a Whip on their Backs; or if they will not work, they should not eat: they ought to be yoaked and made work, and kept under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, since they will not be ruled by their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor obliged by the Bonds of men, as before: And this is a Wisdom and Justice that is no way against Charity, but very subservient thereunto. But if, through the infirmity of humane Nature, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Casualty, to which all are subject, any man be brought to a poor and afflicted state, then we are much more obliged to relieve them, and that Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; for this is necessary to shew our thankfulness to God, that hath not left us to the same Infirmities and Casualties which might have made us even as poor as they: And 2ly, To shew our sympathy and fellow-feeling of the common miseries of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so to shew our selves men; that is, living Members of the Community of Mankind: And also 3ly, To shew our Humility and Generosity in the state of Dignity and Advancement above others, which is to shew our selves brave and wise men: And 4ly. To provide for our own Honour and greatest Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this World, and Eternal Felicity in the next.</p>
                  <p>But lastly, If they be poor Christians, and have given Evidence of their true Piety, this adds mightily to the Obligation, our being liberal in our Charity towards them; we are then not only one flesh with them, in that we are made of one Blood, but by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, of which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37329:116"/> Christ is the Head; and so our uncharitableness to them, is cruelty against Christ himself, and proves us to be dead members of his spiritual body, and meer nominal Christians: If we had the Vital Influences of the Spirit from Christ, we could not but sympathize with all our fellow-members, and be afflicted in all their sufferings, and be like our Lord in kind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descentions and liberal Distributions towards them, as I observed in my Letter, and is not unprofitable to be here repeated.</p>
                  <p>But where all these Obligations meet in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and yet cannot bind men to the exercise of Charity towards them in whom they are, such seem like the man possessed with a Legion of Devils, in that there must be in them a Complication of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of evil affections, making them as averse from true Christian Communion, and the duties thereof, as he, by many Devils, was made averse from humane Conversation: and these are as much inclined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, in Mind and Thoughts, in the mountainous heights of Pride, Ambition, and Ostentation of a great Estate; and in act, in the practice of such Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are the Monuments of many ruined Persons and Families (as well as cause of their ruine;) as he was to dwell only in the Mountains and among the Tombs of the dead.</p>
                  <p>But it is not sufficient, to the perfection of Christian Charit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37329:116"/> of his preventing Grace, which is far the largest in Extent. I say, this Faith must work by Love, as to God, so to Mankind, and to the latter so far, that the general knowledge of mans subjection to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miseries and distresses and that there are many that want relief, should cause us to seek out very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously for those that want our help; and be more glad of finding occasions for the exercise of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than the poor are that they have found a good Benefactor: this is Christian Charity indeed.</p>
                  <p>But he that prevents Poverty, doth better than he that relieves the Poor; therefore it must be reckoned among the chief of good works, when men of great Estates provide so, that no persons that live near them, should have cause to complain, that they would work but can find no body to imploy them; And he that doth thus, prevents a multitude of Sins that men are betrayed unto by Idleness, and as many Diseases, that these Sins and want of Exercise brings on them; and so becomes a kind of Saviour to their Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies together. 'Tis not for me to propound the many ways of Imployment that may be found out, but I believe it may be demonstrated, that very few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween seven and seventy years of age, but are capable of getting their Bread, and that men in their strength are capable of getting so much more as would suffice to provide for their younger Children, and lay up somewhat for their older age; so that if the Rich be defective in providing them work, their miseries are partly imputable to them: And it seems to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thing to be able by ones money to put life and activity into a multitude, whether young or old, that else would be as unactive trunks, and their lives use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to themselves or others.</p>

                  <p>But alass, the World is out of order, the Rich as will as the Poor neglect their duty; and we are to to take our measures in doing good works, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what should be, but according to what is. Now certain it is, that multitudes, who being utterly unprovided of what is necessary for their support in the fore-mentioned Cases, fall into great distress there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and it is also certain, that those who are most able to relieve them, are hindred, either by multitude of business or the greatness of their estate, from making such inquiry as is necessary for the relieving these singly: Therefore it is an act worthy such persons, <hi>to build places of Entertainment, and to indow them with a Maintenance, into which such persons may be put; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting the care of inquiring into their necessities and merits, to such persons as are fit for the same:</hi> which may be secured for perpetuity, if there be five or six of these Trustees, and as one died, the rest have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to choose another in his room.</p>
                  <p>It is also a very good work to provide for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Children in the knowledge of Letters, that they may be fitted for Humane Conversation; but especially that they may be able to perform their part in Sacred Offices; for which cause alone, he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the use of it, would think it worth his cost to have Children learn to Read: I know much is said
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37329:117"/> against the Book, as a hindrance to the Plough, and that especially in such whose bodily labour may seem to tend more to the publick good (which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be preferred before the pleasures of Fancy) than their Contemplation can do. Yet I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend but so much Book-learning as will inable them to read the Scriptures, and to perform what is required in the Common Prayer, hath so many more advantages to good than occasions of any ill, that it may be accounted among good works to promote it.</p>
                  <p>Especially if Schools and Work-houses were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and Children were kept to work three hours, and taught to read one; by this means their Schooling would not beget a habit of Idleness, which sometimes becomes incurable.</p>
                  <p>And by this means, if there be any among the poorer sort that are of excellent Capacities, they may be recommended unto the Bishop and Presbytery of the Diocess, to be Educated for the best Service of Church and State: And I believe a good Order in this case would produce great benefits, and prevent manifold mischiefs. And for the rest, their Parents or the Parishes would be directed to put them to such Trades as are suitable to their Capacities; therefore he that by his Purse or by his pains promotes this, I think doth a good work.</p>
                  <p>If either of these fall to Debauchery, and neglect the improvement of their Capacities, either of Mind or Body, for the publick good and their own, after they have been so educated as before, there is no greater charity for these than a House of Correction; and if the punishment to Scholars were to be kept hard to work, it would bring them to a sense of their folly in negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their Studies for the sake of pleasure, and might
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37329:118"/> effect a reformation sooner than the fear of losing or of taking away the benefit they might otherwise have by their Learning, and leaving them to Idleness and Poverty; and if those that will not work at the Trade they have been bred to, were for a time put to harder labour, and forced to work, by hunger and stripes, it would teach them to govern themselves better afterward: The Vertue of this is such, that in some Countries the Richest, who have Sons that will not govern themselves according to the Rules of Reason and the nature of their Education, do put them <hi>(incognito)</hi> into such places of hard labour to make them wiser; and I wish Conveniency for the same, and the practice of it here, but this on the by.</p>
                  <p>A discovery being made of the Capacities of poor Children by the School, the next good work of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to assist their preparations to get a livelihood in the world, and to become serviceable thereunto, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving somewhat either to help to put them Apprentice to some Trade, or to assist their Education at School, and the University, if they appear to have such eminent Capacities as aforesaid; and this latter is an excellent work, because such Boys having natural Abilities, and Poverty being so great a Spur to their Industry, often prove great Scholars, and make their own way to great Preferments, and do great Service in Church or State; and so the effect of such Charity will be, first, plenty and honour to the Persons and their Families whom we have helped to advance; 2ly, that we shall have a share in the reward of all the good that they do in the world, both from God and men. As for the former, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Poor Boys that are put Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Trades they have a natural fitness for, it seems harder for them to raise themselves without some stock
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37329:118"/> to work on; and therefore in some cases it is a good work to intrust them with such a stock, but yet with this Caution, that they be persons <hi>humble, frugal, and prudent;</hi> for there are many that are excellently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished to make good Servants and Journey-men, that are so naturally unfit to be Masters, that if their own Parents or Friends do set them up never so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously, they will ruine themselves, or at least run out of all that is lent them: Now such as these ought to know themselves so well, as to be contented to live as Journey-men to others, and not aspire to such a state wherein they may run themselves in debt, and involve themselves in such troubles and snares that they are neither capable of enjoyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or serving others: And every wise man will so well consider the person on whom he exercises his Charity and Benificence in this kind, that he may be more like to do him good than hurt, and he may be sure he shall do so, if they have the Vertues fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: And those that are intrusted with the Charity of others, ought to be the wisest of men, and more careful that it be well disposed than if it were their own, because herein they shew themselves both faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and charitable.</p>
                  <p>And here give me leave to note one thing, much as I think for publick good; and it it this, That those who are intrusted in such Affairs, be persons of good Principles in matters of Religion, that they may take care the Youth in such places be well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in that respect, for this is of great avail both for their own good and that of the publick; and we have a great Example in the Care of his <hi>Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> in disposing the Trusts of those famous Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of His Renowned Predecessor King <hi>Edward;</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37329:119"/> I mean the Hospitals of this City, which, however libelled by some, is of great use for the good of City and Kingdom; for the dispose of publick Charity, gets men almost as great an Interest as if it were their own, and in times wherein there is Contest for Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Interests, and such are set up as tend to the dissolving all Law and Government by a major Vote: Sure no man of sence can blame a Care in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I do not doubt but that (whatever discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented men suggest against it) the alteration will tend to the increase of good works and advantage of these Foundations; and do most humbly beseech the present Governours, that they will give Testimony to the World, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> begets and breeds up her Sons to as noble and heroick underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of this kind, as any Conventicles of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks can do theirs, and much more.</p>
                  <p>I speak not this to offend any man, but to direct those of our way in this matter, as I am sure such as take most offence would do those of their own, if it were in a like case; and then their own practice would justifie what I write, as their reason will, I am sure, do now if it might be heard.</p>
                  <p>The fore-mentioned acts of Charity tend to the maintenance and support of Life; now that which is next to Life is Liberty, and therefore he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures Liberty to Captives doth a Good Work.</p>
                  <p>But of Captives we must make distinction, some there are that bring themselves into Captivity by their Vices; and many of these persons are so perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to humane Society, that a Prison is the sittest place for them, and the best Charity to these is to provide so that they may be kept to work in Prison, that they may not have time and temptation to plot
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37329:119"/> mischief there, nor to act such wickedness among themselves as they commonly do; But to deliver these out of Prison, and set them at liberty to cheat and couzen and run in debt with all they can meet with that are of a credulous temper, or to do worse mischiefs, this deserves not the name of Charity, of a Good Work. But there are some who by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or natural infirmity become subject to Arrests, and by the Cruelly of their Creditors are cast into Prison, not that they can expect any thing from them, but for the gratification of their own revengeful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; for these think I we should first mediate and see to perswade their Creditors to release them; and secondly, If they will not be wrought upon without some part of their debts, assist them to pay it.</p>
                  <p>But there are another sort of Captives, that it is a greater work of Charity to redeem; and they are such as are taken by Pirats by Enemies as they are trading on the Sea, for that these are snatcht from their Trade and Imployment, and from their dear Relations, being often exposed to great temptations to forsake their Religion, and oppressed with cruel Servitude to Infidels; therefore none that hath any thing in him of a man or of a Christian, none that hath any sense of the honour and welfare of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of the lamentable condition of Families so bereft of their Heads and Governours, and of the afflictions of <hi>generous minds</hi> under the Insultations of men more base than such as have been the meanest Servants, (as sometimes happens in this case) but will think himself obliged to do his best to assist the Redemption of such Captives.</p>
                  <p>Next to Livelihood and Liberty, is the Comfort and Security of Humane Life. In relation to which,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37329:120"/> I shall mention two or three things which rich men may promote to very good purpose; the first is, Their mending Highways, and making them more safe and pleasant to Travellers; and providing Watches to prevent Robberies; I know the Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that these things be done by the Country (as they do also that the poor shall be relieved of the charge of the Parish) but, as there is abundant room for private Charity, notwithstanding any provision made for the Poor by vertue of the Laws, in one kind, so is there also for the Benificence of rich men in the other, besides what the Country will ever be inforced to do on the same account.</p>
                  <p>The second is, the provision of a place of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for those that have a recess from worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and have little left to do here but to serve God, and provide for their joyful reception into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. I mean this not so much for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that need others Charity, (of which before) but for those that being able to pay sufficiently for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation in this kind but can no where find any so desirable as might be thus provided; therefore if one or more rich men would venture the charge, (which I know will not be small) and then make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Invitation to persons under such Circumstances to partake of the benefit thereof at a valuable price, it would be a good work, and might have good effects.</p>
                  <p>And I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t here propose to consideration, that there are multitudes of aged persons both men and women, who having disposed of their Children in marriage, and reserved a competent Estate to themselves, are very m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t go to board with their Children,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37329:120"/> where (as I observed before) the Authority of a Father or Mother intervearing with that of a Master or Mistress, often produceth such effects as are much to the vexation of aged people; and this is so commonly known, that it need only be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Others I have heard of, that have removed into the Country, where the change of Air and Company, and other Circumstances have shortned their lives; and many other inconveniences might be named that men are subject to in seeking a fit Retirement in their old age: Now the provision of such a place as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, might be a great prevention of such inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to persons of that quality, and, were I in such Circumstances, I should rather take up my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein than in any other I can think of. I will not undertake to make a description of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture and Appendages of such a place; for I never was nor ever am like to be capable of any great works, but I have heard somewhat of the <hi>Charterhouse,</hi> which so well pleaseth my Fancy, that if a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such a place, among a great many persons of my own Age and Rank, where I might choose some of like affection to my self, for Intimacy of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enjoy the society of the rest in publick duties of Religion, and have innocent divertisements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles. I say, if a Habitation in such a place were to be purchased for my life, I should (after I had provided for my Family, and when I were bereft of my Wife by death) far rather choose it than to live with any of my Children, or in any Family of my Friends and Relations whatsoever. And I believe there would be hundreds more of my mind, and that on trial would bless the memory of any that should provide so well for the happiness of their old age, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37329:121"/> be most willing to pay liberally for it. And I am apt to believe that however the first Contrivers of this (as of other the most useful projects) might be great Losers, (which is the great discouragement of such underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings) yet in process of time it might come to be a very beneficial thing to the Heirs of such persons; but I shall insist no further on this, Designing only to offer at such things as come to mind, and leave it to wiser men to perfect them.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing of like nature that I would propose as a good work; and that is, a place where Orphans and young people, especially Maidens, may have the most pleasant and profitable entertainment and greatest security against the Cheats and Tempta, tions that ruine multitudes of them.</p>
                  <p>It seems to me very evident, that Boarding-Schools do not give such Entertainment nor Security as such a place might be made to do; and also that it might be so provided without any danger of the introducing such Vows of perpetual Virginity and restraints on any safe and profitable liberty of Virgins, as is among the <hi>Papists.</hi> And many wise men have I heard to wish concerning those places which were first designed to such uses, that the corruptions (growing by time like the Rust on Iron) had been scowred off, and the thing left in its primitive Glory; and I could wish so to, but wishes avail not, the thing must be begun <hi>de novo,</hi> and may be so done as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Abuses, as far as is possible, by intrusting the Government of those places in such persons as will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently study the happiness and welfare of such young people, and take care that they be educated in the fear of God, and made daily to attend the publick Offices of Religion, and taught to perform their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37329:121"/> part therein, in the most decent and graceful manner; That they he taught such ingenious Arts and Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Work and healthful Exercises, and taught them in a pleasing variety, and that those who excel in any faculty among them have due honour, and the rest taught to give them respect according to their worth, and to learn of them; that if any prove so vicious as to study ways to evade the good Orders of the House, and corrupt others, they should be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly if either the City (who are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with so many Orphans) would undertake the provision of such a place, or any other person would do it, that can spare money without prejudice to their Families, until such a project might take effect; it could not but answer the Charge, and in time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Income suitable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I shall add but one thing more as advantageous to all the rest, and that is the providing for the perpetual honour of those that do good works, by setting up in Churches and Halls, and other publick places, large Tables, wherein should be written in fair Letters the Names of such Benefactors, with their Donations; and that Parishes and other Corporations should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to keep the same Tables fair and legible to perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>Against this some have objected the reproof given by our Saviour to the <hi>Pharisees, For seeking glory of men,</hi> Matth. 6. his affirming <hi>that he honoured not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor received honour of men,</hi> John 5. &amp; 8. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>secrecy in Alms-giving,</hi> Matth. 6. and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the possibility of believing to those <hi>who received honour one of another,</hi> John 5.44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which it may be answered, That neither these or any other Scriptures can be so understood, as to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37329:122"/> forbid either the publick performance of good works, or a respect unto the honour we may have thereby; for 'tis required, <hi>That our light so shine before men, that they may see our good works;</hi> that we should <hi>think on those things that are praised, seek for glory and hinour by well-doing.</hi> Our Saviour himself had respect to the <hi>Joy of that reward which was set before him.</hi> One chief part of which was, that he should have a <hi>Name at which every knee should bow,</hi> Phil. 210. A good Name is esteemed by <hi>Solomon, better than great riches;</hi> and such is the name of being Munificent and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and we must esteem and judge of things as they are, and seek them according to their worth; and if we might not, the Scriptures would in vain propose the <hi>praise and honour</hi> that is consequent to <hi>good works,</hi> as an encouragement thereunto.</p>
                  <p>That which seems truth in this matter, is this; Men must not seek their own honour, so as to make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent ostentation of their good works, yet as it is subordinate to God's honour, and useful to provoke others to follow them, they may: And although, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what men should be, the proposal of such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may seem needless; yet not so, if we consider what most men are; in which respect we should use all ways to excite them to good works; and, after all and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, our prayers to God to make it effectual.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I shall here conclude with that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Collect of our Church, 25th after <hi>Trinity;</hi> in which I desire all good men to joyn with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stir up we beseech thee the Wills of thy faithful people, that they, plentifully bringing forth the fruit of Good Works, may of thee be plentifully rewarded, Through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>
